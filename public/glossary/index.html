The statement must include information about accessibility issues on a system, contact information, enforcement procedure, as well as several other legally required sections. There is a specific template in the UK that must be followed for accessibility statements under PSBAR. Private companies or others not covered by PSBAR may choose to write an accessibility statement.

Many disabled users may have trouble accessing content in its original format and request an alt format. For example, a blind user may have trouble using a PDF scan of a document because that PDF is an image produced by a scanner, not text in a document. That user may ask for a computer readable alternative, such as the text in a Microsoft Word document, so that it can be read out by the user's screen reader. There are legal requirements in the UK around providing reasonable alternative formats when asked to do so.</p></dd></div><div class="glossary__item-wrapper"><dt class="glossary__term" id="alt-text" tabindex="-1">Alt text</dt><dd class="glossary__definition"><p>Alternative (Alt) text descriptions, alt-tags (they're often incorrectly called alt tags, they're attributes) or alt-attributes are phrases used to describe text which is associated with an image.

Semi-automated tools typically require a user to run the tool against a page, whereas automated tools can be scheduled to test entire sites.

Typically in web accessibility this relates to the background colour and the foreground colour, the background would be any colour directly underneath text, icons or controls etc and the foreground colour would be the text, control or icon etc. This is especially important, as very low contrast makes things harder to read or perceive for a large amount of users</p></dd></div><div class="glossary__item-wrapper"><dt class="glossary__term" id="content" tabindex="-1">Content</dt><dd class="glossary__definition"><p>When we say content we are referring to anything that is user generated for example the text and images that goes into a web article, documents or other user generated material.</p></dd></div><div class="glossary__item-wrapper"><dt class="glossary__term" id="dom" tabindex="-1"><abbr>DOM</abbr></dt><dd class="glossary__definition"><p>Document Object Model, The structural representation of a webpage, which allows access to other technologies to manipulate it, enhance it or parse (read) it</p></dd></div><div class="glossary__item-wrapper"><dt class="glossary__term" id="decorative-image" tabindex="-1">Decorative image</dt><dd class="glossary__definition"><p>Some images are described as &quot;decorative&quot; in that they do not show any important information relevant to the context of the discussion.

Within the Dev Tools, we can see all of the page's HTML, CSS and JavaScript and we can access accessibility information about the page, tools in various browsers have different options, so it's useful to use them in multiple browsers</p></dd></div><div class="glossary__item-wrapper"><dt class="glossary__term" id="digital-inclusion" tabindex="-1">Digital Inclusion</dt><dd class="glossary__definition"><p>Digital inclusion is often associated with accessibility, but digital inclusion is a different but related topic.

The purpose of which is to get us to think about our content and how we engage with these users in a world where &quot;online&quot; is the first route for most things.</p></dd></div><div class="glossary__item-wrapper"><dt class="glossary__term" id="digital-literacy" tabindex="-1">Digital Literacy</dt><dd class="glossary__definition"><p>Digital literacy refers to user's familiarity and confidence with computers and the internet. For example someone that has spent a lot of time on the internet and is capable of independently using a computer to achieve most tasks is considered digitally literate. On the other hand, someone who may not have had much interaction with computers due to age, economic circumstances, or other factors, may not be familiar with controls or navigating a computer or website, and may not be able to complete tasks by themselves. This kind of user would be less digitally literate depending on how much help they need.</p></dd></div><div class="glossary__item-wrapper"><dt class="glossary__term" id="disproportionate-burden" tabindex="-1">Disproportionate Burden</dt><dd class="glossary__definition"><p>Claiming disproportionate burden is a mechanism within the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations (PSBAR) for organisations to explain why meeting a very specific part of the regulations in a single case is not feasible at this time. Claiming disproportionate burden requires significant evidence of financial, time, resources and other impacts among other things and must show it is not substantially impacting disabled users of a system. An organisation can only claim disproportionate burden after an assessment has been completed.</p></dd></div><div class="glossary__item-wrapper"><dt class="glossary__term" id="dragon" tabindex="-1">Dragon</dt><dd class="glossary__definition"><p>Dragon Naturally Speaking, Voice input software that enables users to control computers with their voice</p></dd></div><div class="glossary__item-wrapper"><dt class="glossary__term" id="eass" tabindex="-1"><abbr>EASS</abbr></dt><dd class="glossary__definition"><p>The Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS) for part of the monitoring process for the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations (PSBAR).
