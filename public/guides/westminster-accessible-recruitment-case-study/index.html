Accessibility</li></ul><p>The purpose of this improvement activity was to trial options to offer a more inclusive recruitment process and deliver practical application of the University of Westminster EDI principles:</p><ul><li>Creating an inclusive culture which enables people to reach their full potential.</li><li>Promoting equality of opportunity and furthering social inclusion and mobility within and beyond the university.</li><li>Placing diversity, inclusion, and equality of opportunity at the core of how we engage with applicants.</li></ul><p>The approaches the AELD team took as part of this exercise were:</p><ul><li><p>Creating a <strong>Recruitment Welcome Pack</strong> for interviewees which included:</p><ul><li>Names and pictures of the interview panel.</li><li>Information about the team and the post</li><li>Interview tips and guidance</li><li>Interview questions and tasks</li></ul></li><li><p>Giving the interview questions in advance (as part of the welcome pack).</p></li><li><p>Including a statement on the adverts that we welcome candidates from any backgrounds, welcome applicants with disabilities, and that Westminster are committed to inclusive hiring practices.</p></li><li><p>Having the welcome pack reviewed by neurodiverse student researchers to improve delivery for neurodiverse users.</p></li></ul><p>The aims of these approaches were to:</p><ul><li>Make the process as transparent as possible.</li><li>Support neurodiverse applicants by giving them information and enabling them to plan and prepare.</li><li>Make it clear that Westminster wanted applicants to succeed in this process.</li><li>Put applicants at ease so that they can do their best at interview.</li><li>Enable applicants to plan and research their answers (enabling candidates to do their best).</li></ul><p>“We wanted to make the interview not about finding someone who is best at thinking on their feet or answering interview questions, but rather, to find the candidate who aligns with the needs of the role and the service.”</p><p>When first suggesting a change to the interview process there were some expected initial concerns and assumptions:</p><ul><li>Everyone will do well, including applicants who were not in fact suitable for the role.</li><li>In giving questions in advance, candidates could get help or look up answers to find what they think we might want to hear.</li></ul><p>To mitigate the concerns about over enabling lower quality candidates, the Westminster team added the following actions to the interview process:</p><ul><li>Using follow up questions as appropriate which are not given in advance (though candidates are aware this may happen) to probe deeper into answers.</li><li>Having clear scoring criteria and expectations from each question. Knowing what different levels of answers should look like can help to better rank responses.</li><li>A diverse panel ensured that as a team we were adhering to University EDI principles and policies. Mitigates some risk of consistent structural biases.</li></ul><p>The Westminster team not only wanted to trial and provide their own feedback on the changed recruitment process but were keen to get feedback from the candidates themselves. As part of the commitment to transparency in the process, the trial status of this process and the request for feedback from all candidates post offers being made (so that feedback would not impact any judging) was clearly communicated.</p><p>The outcomes from this case study therefore includes feedback from the interview panel members and from the candidates about their experience.</p><div class="cms__anchor-wrapper"><h2 id="panel-feedback" tabindex="-1">Panel feedback</h2><a class="cms__anchor" href="#panel-feedback" aria-labelledby="panel-feedback"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="32" width="32" viewBox="4 14 40 20"><path d="M22.5 34H14q-4.2 0-7-3t-3-7q0-4.2 3-7t7-3h8.5v3H14q-2.9 0-5 2-2 2.1-2 5t2 5q2.1 2 5 2h8.5Zm-6.3-8.5v-3h15.6v3Zm9.3 8.5v-3H34q2.9 0 5-2 2-2.1 2-5t-2-5q-2.1-2-5-2h-8.5v-3H34q4.2 0 7 3t3 7q0 4.2-3 7t-7 3Z"></path></svg></a></div><ul><li>Even with the questions in advance, there were still clear differences in candidates’ strengths and answers.</li><li>Candidates did not necessarily answer questions in the way that we required / anticipated.</li><li>Even with the interview questions sent in advance and best practice tips written on the interview pack, some candidates lacked general interview or digital skills.</li><li>The use of follow up questions worked well to identify depth of knowledge and understanding from candidates and was a significant help in identifying successful candidates.</li><li>On two occasions, we completed follow up interviews to ensure we were completely happy with our chosen candidate which strengthened the overall process where that was necessary.</li><li>The scoring criteria ensured there was a consistency when marking the answers.</li><li>The panel felt they were able to distinguish clearly between the candidates suitable and not suitable for the role.</li><li>The questions given in advance in the interview pack did not mean every candidate answered them fully and appropriately.</li></ul><div class="cms__anchor-wrapper"><h2 id="candidate-feedback" tabindex="-1">Candidate feedback</h2><a class="cms__anchor" href="#candidate-feedback" aria-labelledby="candidate-feedback"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="32" width="32" viewBox="4 14 40 20"><path d="M22.5 34H14q-4.2 0-7-3t-3-7q0-4.2 3-7t7-3h8.5v3H14q-2.9 0-5 2-2 2.1-2 5t2 5q2.1 2 5 2h8.5Zm-6.3-8.5v-3h15.6v3Zm9.3 8.5v-3H34q2.9 0 5-2 2-2.1 2-5t-2-5q-2.1-2-5-2h-8.5v-3H34q4.2 0 7 3t3 7q0 4.2-3 7t-7 3Z"></path></svg></a></div><p>16 candidates gave formal feedback.

Accessible recruitment is quite literally the practical actions to live up to those commitments. But not only is it a way of delivering on your responsibilities, but it is better for everyone involved. A definitive win-win for both recruiters and applicants.</p><p>Specifically, we like that the AELD team:</p><ul><li>Engaged users in the creation of their improved content. Working with disabled users to refine work and provide feedback is always a great step.</li><li>Created a welcoming environment where candidates feel they are encouraged to have a “good” interview rather than it being a catch you out exercise.</li><li>Included the questions in advance. There is often worry that candidates will give a thought out answer rather than a quick answer, but surely that is a better indicator of professional behaviour desired in a candidate.</li></ul><div class="cms__anchor-wrapper"><h2 id="resources" tabindex="-1">Resources</h2><a class="cms__anchor" href="#resources" aria-labelledby="resources"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="32" width="32" viewBox="4 14 40 20"><path d="M22.5 34H14q-4.2 0-7-3t-3-7q0-4.2 3-7t7-3h8.5v3H14q-2.9 0-5 2-2 2.1-2 5t2 5q2.1 2 5 2h8.5Zm-6.3-8.5v-3h15.6v3Zm9.3 8.5v-3H34q2.9 0 5-2 2-2.1 2-5t-2-5q-2.1-2-5-2h-8.5v-3H34q4.2 0 7 3t3 7q0 4.2-3 7t-7 3Z"></path></svg></a></div><p>Download a copy of the <a href="/docs/oct-21-interview-pack.pdf">Westminster welcome pack</a> created during the case study.</p></article><div class="socials__container" role="group" aria-labelledby="shareTitle"><h2 class="socials__title" id="shareTitle">Share on:</h2><a href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Westminster%20accessible%20recruitment%20case%20study&url=https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/westminster-accessible-recruitment-case-study/" class="socials__link"><svg role="img" focusable="false" aria-label="Twitter" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M22.46 6c-.77.35-1.6.58-2.46.69a4.3 4.3 0 0 0 1.88-2.38c-.83.5-1.75.85-2.72 1.05a4.28 4.28 0 0 0-7.32 3.91A12.2 12.2 0 0 1 3 4.79a4.24 4.24 0 0 0 1.33 5.71c-.71 0-1.37-.2-1.95-.5v.03a4.3 4.3 0 0 0 3.44 4.21 4.22 4.22 0 0 1-1.93.07 4.28 4.28 0 0 0 4 2.98 8.52 8.52 0 0 1-5.33 1.84c-.34 0-.68-.02-1.02-.06A12.14 12.14 0 0 0 8.12 21C16 21 20.33 14.46 20.33 8.79l-.01-.56A8.57 8.57 0 0 0 22.46 6Z"/></svg></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/westminster-accessible-recruitment-case-study/&title=Westminster%20accessible%20recruitment%20case%20study" class="socials__link"><svg role="img" focusable="false" aria-label="LinkedIn" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M1 2.84A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 2.84 1h18.32A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 23 2.84v18.32A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 21.16 23H2.84A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 1 21.16V2.84Zm8.7 6.55h2.99v1.5c.43-.87 1.53-1.64 3.18-1.64 3.17 0 3.92 1.71 3.92 4.86v5.82h-3.2v-5.1c0-1.8-.44-2.8-1.53-2.8-1.51 0-2.14 1.08-2.14 2.8v5.1H9.7V9.39Zm-5.5 10.4h3.22V9.25H4.2v10.54ZM7.88 5.81a2.06 2.06 0 1 1-4.12 0 2.06 2.06 0 0 1 4.13 0Z" clip-rule="evenodd"/></svg></a></div><aside class="author-bio author-bio--with-image"><h2 class="author-bio__title">About George</h2><img class="author-bio__img" height="128" width="128" src="/profileImg/grhodes.jpeg" alt="Profile picture of George Rhodes"><div class="author-bio__intro"><p>George is an experienced and award winning public sector professional having worked with Central and Local Government, Universities, Colleges, Schools, NHS, Police Forces, Fire & Rescue Services and more. For several years George's focus has been on the delivery of accessible and inclusive services for all citizens. Known for his extensive knowledge on UK accessibility legislation, he is the author of the original accessibility statement monitoring in Europe and his work on both statements and disproportionate burden misuse has been discussed by the European Commission as an exemplar for delivering accessibility for public services.
