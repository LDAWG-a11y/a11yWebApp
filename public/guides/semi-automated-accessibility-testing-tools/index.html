We’re primarily going to use Google Chrome for installing any extensions, but where extensions are available on other browsers, we will of course provide links to those extensions and state if they’re unavailable on a particular browser. It’s also worth noting that where we refer to Google Chrome, the installation process is the same for Microsoft Edge and the Brave browser, as these use the same underlying technologies as Chrome, called Chromium. Firefox and Safari have their own underlying technologies.</p><p><strong>Aside:</strong> It’s also recommended to follow long on a laptop or desktop (MacOS, Windows or Linux) as installing extensions isn’t always possible on tablets and phones.</p><h3>What is Semi-automated testing?</h3><p>Where digital accessibility is concerned, semi-automated testing is the use of third-party tools to check for any detectable accessibility issues on webpages (usually 1 page at a time, hence why it is semi-automated). These tools can provide a vital first line of defence against many common accessibility issues, such as:</p><ul><li>Invalid HTML code</li><li>Images with missing alt text</li><li>Colour contrast issues</li><li>Controls such as buttons or links, without an accessible name</li><li>Misuse of or missing ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications, the attributes that help assistive technologies understand parts of a webpage, where the HTML alone does not provide sufficient meaning)</li><li>Focus order, which ensures that users using keyboards to consume and navigate web content reach the content in a logical order, that matches the source code</li><li>A good heading hierarchy and page structure, using landmarks which help users of assistive technologies easily find interesting bits of content</li></ul><p>The list above is by no means exhaustive, but they are some of the most common issues detected. It’s also worth noting that these tools are not perfect, no tool can completely test a page, in fact, automated or semi-automated tools typically only pick up around 40% of known accessibility issues, but they are a invaluable tools and it’s great practice to familiarise yourself with them and check your pages or sites to get a basic overview of the accessibility.</p><h3>Tell me about the tools</h3><p>Every accessibility professional will have a toolkit, usually a folder full of bookmarks, several browser extensions and some bookmarklets that test specific things, these will naturally differ between individuals, so this list is again not exhaustive.</p><p>There's a couple of considerations to be aware of before we delve into the tools:</p><ul><li>Some of these tools reside in the &quot;DevTools&quot;, when we reference &quot;DevTools&quot;, we're referring to the browsers' code inspectors, where we can view all of the HTML, CSS and much more for the current page. To access the DevTools, you can right-click anywhere on the page and selecting <strong>Inspect</strong> or <strong>Inspect Element</strong>, alternatively, you can just press the <kbd>F12</kbd> key and it will open up (depending on your keyboard, you may need to press the <kbd>function</kbd> or <kbd>fn</kbd> key, along with <kbd>F12</kbd>).</li><li>It’s also worth noting that Semi-automated tools won’t test content that is hidden in the DOM, as an example, if you had a page with a modal, you’d need to test the page with the modal closed and then again with it open and this applies to all disclosure type widgets. We often run tools on a page that has interactive widgets and it can at times look quite positive, not too many errors, nothing difficult to resolve for the developers. When we click a button to show a date picker, modal, accordion, navigation etc, this interactive content is exposed to both the DOM and the accessibility tree, the previously hidden elements often expose a litany of accessibility issues.</li></ul><div class="cms__anchor-wrapper"><h2 id="axe-browser-extension" tabindex="-1">Axe browser extension</h2><a class="cms__anchor" href="#axe-browser-extension" aria-labelledby="axe-browser-extension"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="32" width="32" viewBox="4 14 40 20"><path d="M22.5 34H14q-4.2 0-7-3t-3-7q0-4.2 3-7t7-3h8.5v3H14q-2.9 0-5 2-2 2.1-2 5t2 5q2.1 2 5 2h8.5Zm-6.3-8.5v-3h15.6v3Zm9.3 8.5v-3H34q2.9 0 5-2 2-2.1 2-5t-2-5q-2.1-2-5-2h-8.5v-3H34q4.2 0 7 3t3 7q0 4.2-3 7t-7 3Z"></path></svg></a></div><p>Axe is available on Chrome, Firefox and Edge; sadly it’s unavailable on Safari. Axe is a free browser extension that can run a series of tests on a single page at a time.</p><h3>How to use Axe</h3><p><a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/">Visit the Axe browser extension page</a>, where there are links for each of the previously mentioned browsers. Simply visit that page in the browser you want to use Axe with and click the <strong>Install free [your browser]</strong> extension, which will then navigate to the extensions store for that particular browser, once there, click the <strong>add to [your browser]</strong> button and follow any on-screen prompts.</p><p>Axe resides in your DevTools, so once you have those open, we will need to click on the correct tab, within the DevTools (the position of this will be different than the following image, as I have moved it to to the left, so it is always easy to find for me.</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/guideImg/e3LpskQn8M-300.webp 300w, /guideImg/e3LpskQn8M-600.webp 600w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/png" srcset="/guideImg/e3LpskQn8M-300.png 300w, /guideImg/e3LpskQn8M-600.png 600w" sizes="100vw"><img class="guide__image" decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The Axe DevTools tab, highlighted within Chrome's DevTools panel" src="/guideImg/e3LpskQn8M-300.png" width="600" height="331"></picture></p><p>Once we open the <strong>Axe</strong> tab, we are presented with the Axe interface in which there are 2 primary panels. There is the <strong>Let’s get started</strong> panel and the <strong>Start an Intelligent Guided Test</strong> panel. We don’t need to worry about the latter, that’s the paid version, which teaches you how to manually test those elements that tools alone cannot test.</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/guideImg/aSj7jnbFEr-300.webp 300w, /guideImg/aSj7jnbFEr-600.webp 600w, /guideImg/aSj7jnbFEr-900.webp 900w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/png" srcset="/guideImg/aSj7jnbFEr-300.png 300w, /guideImg/aSj7jnbFEr-600.png 600w, /guideImg/aSj7jnbFEr-900.png 900w" sizes="100vw"><img class="guide__image" decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The Let's get started panel highlighted, within Axe DevTools" src="/guideImg/aSj7jnbFEr-300.png" width="900" height="587"></picture></p><p>Within the <strong>Let’s get started</strong> panel, the option we need to concern ourselves with is the <strong>Scan ALL my page</strong> button. This does exactly what it indicates it will do and it performs an analysis on the current page.</p><p>I ran this test against Wikipedia, as I needed to demonstrate on a website and we won't find any issues on this one, Wikipedia is public enough and well known enough to be a suitable example. Disclaimer, we are not here to test Wikipedia, we’re just demonstrating using the tools.</p><h3>Interpreting the test results</h3><p>So, we have several panels of interest, after we click the <strong>Scan ALL my page</strong> button, it may be necessary to either drag the DevTools up to be able to see those panels or alternatively you can detach the DevTools from the browser window, by clicking the 3 vertical dots (<strong>Customise and control DevTools</strong> button) and then in the <strong>Dock side</strong> options select <strong>undock into a separate window</strong> (visually represented by 2 rectangles 1 overlaying the other), choose whichever option works best for you.</p><ul><li>The first panel we encounter is the <strong>Total issues</strong> panel, within this panel it will inform us how many actual issues and/or potential issues it has detected, as well as the severity of those issues</li><li>The second panel we encounter is the <strong>All issues</strong> panel, which is essentially a summary of issue type</li><li>The final panel is the <strong>Issue Description</strong> panel, which provides details about each detected issue</li></ul><p>The free version does not allow us to test against a specific level of WCAG, for instance, many people will be most interested in meeting the AA standard (which is the minimum legal requirement in many countries or sectors), which means satisfying both level A and level AA requirements, the free version tests against A, AA and even AAA. So, in reality, some of the errors we get may not be actual failures against the level we’re aiming for, but it's important to note that legal conformance does not necessarily mean accessible, WCAG compliance is the floor, not the ceiling, so aim high, your users deserve it.</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/guideImg/J6fsJd9Jsq-300.webp 300w, /guideImg/J6fsJd9Jsq-600.webp 600w, /guideImg/J6fsJd9Jsq-900.webp 900w, /guideImg/J6fsJd9Jsq-1200.webp 1200w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/png" srcset="/guideImg/J6fsJd9Jsq-300.png 300w, /guideImg/J6fsJd9Jsq-600.png 600w, /guideImg/J6fsJd9Jsq-900.png 900w, /guideImg/J6fsJd9Jsq-1200.png 1200w" sizes="100vw"><img class="guide__image" decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The test results of a Wikipedia page, after running Axe, showing 159 issues, on a page about computer accessibility, sigh." src="/guideImg/J6fsJd9Jsq-300.png" width="1200" height="419"></picture></p><p>In the <strong>All Issues</strong> panel, our issues are grouped by issue type and adjacent to the issue type is the number of issues for that particular issue type. As an example, the panel says <strong>Links must have discernible text 2</strong> which means 2 link elements on that page have no accessible name.</p><p>If we click that issue, the content of the <strong>Issue description</strong> panel changes to reflect that particular issue, it’s important to note it is only showing the first issue of that type, don’t worry though, we can cycle through any further issues of the same type.</p><h3>Finding the issue</h3><p>At the top of the <strong>Issue description</strong> panel, there are some handy tools that help to quickly locate the issue, both on the page or in the source code:</p><ul><li><strong>Highlight</strong>: clicking this will scroll the element into view and add a highlight and a tooltip to the element in question</li><li><strong>Inspect</strong>: This will open the Elements panel in your DevTools and highlight the particular HTML element that is causing the issue. By viewing the code on our example page, I can see that there is a link that has no hidden or visible text and it surrounds an image with an empty alt attribute. So now I know to report this as an accessibility failure, because links must have an accessible name</li></ul><p>Just below those 2 options, there are some details about the issue, the impact in this case is serious and also we have <strong>Issue Tags</strong>, these inform us that it is an actual failure and it fails both WCAG 2.4.4 Link Text (In Context) and 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value, both of those are level A requirements.</p><p>To find the next issue of that type, at the top of the <strong>Issue description</strong> panel, there are <strong>Next issue</strong> and <strong>Last issue</strong> buttons, these are visually represented as a chevron and double chevron, respectively.</p><p>Further down in the panel, there are some options which will help you to resolve the issue, in this case it’s as simple as adding some text, that will inform users of the purpose of that link, I would suggest alt text here, as these are functional images.</p><p>Automated and semi-automated tools are perfectly imperfect, they can’t second guess developer intent in all circumstances, so oftentimes, the issue will be categorised under <strong>Needs review</strong>. Some common issues that often need review are complex widgets, missing roles and colour contrast. Colour contrast often needs review when backgrounds or font colours use gradients or opacity that is lower than 1 as the algorithm cannot correctly calculate the contrast, so it requires human review.</p><p>Axe provides a useful set of tests to enable you to identify issues on webpages. Always remember to test the page as it first displays, then locate any accordions, modals, tabbed interfaces, disclosure menus or indeed anything else that changes the presentation and/ or functionality of the page and test with each open and it’s likely you will discover additional issues.</p><div class="cms__anchor-wrapper"><h2 id="wave-browser-extension" tabindex="-1">WAVE browser extension</h2><a class="cms__anchor" href="#wave-browser-extension" aria-labelledby="wave-browser-extension"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="32" width="32" viewBox="4 14 40 20"><path d="M22.5 34H14q-4.2 0-7-3t-3-7q0-4.2 3-7t7-3h8.5v3H14q-2.9 0-5 2-2 2.1-2 5t2 5q2.1 2 5 2h8.5Zm-6.3-8.5v-3h15.6v3Zm9.3 8.5v-3H34q2.9 0 5-2 2-2.1 2-5t-2-5q-2.1-2-5-2h-8.5v-3H34q4.2 0 7 3t3 7q0 4.2-3 7t-7 3Z"></path></svg></a></div><p>Wave is available for Chrome, Firefox and Edge and again, not Safari. <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/">Visit the WAVE page</a> and locate the link for your chosen browser’s extension store and follow any prompts to install it.</p><p>The WAVE extension works a little differently, in that it doesn’t require you to use the DevTools, it has a handy button in your extensions bar (usually at the top of your browser). The button’s name is WAVE and it is visually represented as a grey circle with a white letter “W” inside. Alternatively, right clicking anywhere on the page will display a context menu, selecting <strong>Wave this page</strong> will also run the WAVE tool.</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/guideImg/-qZlMMPkSq-300.webp 300w" sizes="100vw"><img class="guide__image" decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of the location of the WAVE extension icon button, in Chrome's extensions bar" src="/guideImg/-qZlMMPkSq-300.png" width="300" height="71"></picture></p><p>The only thing we need to do here, is click the button and the WAVE interface opens up.</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/guideImg/0V5yafJd24-300.webp 300w, /guideImg/0V5yafJd24-600.webp 600w, /guideImg/0V5yafJd24-900.webp 900w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/png" srcset="/guideImg/0V5yafJd24-300.png 300w, /guideImg/0V5yafJd24-600.png 600w, /guideImg/0V5yafJd24-900.png 900w" sizes="100vw"><img class="guide__image" decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of WAVE's interface open on a page, the issues panel is highlighted." src="/guideImg/0V5yafJd24-300.png" width="900" height="595"></picture></p><h3>Interpreting the test results</h3><p>The WAVE interface usually appears on the left of the screen, although this may change dependant on viewport size, resolution or zoom settings.</p><p>There is A <strong>Summary</strong> section, which displays a tabbed interface, each tab, with the exception of the <strong>Summary</strong> tab provides additional information about the page as a whole:</p><p>The <strong>Details</strong> tab lists all of the page information detected, it’s important to note that these are not all errors, some will be checking the page’s structure and some will be <strong>Alerts</strong> which are those checks that require manual review.</p><p>Each section in the <strong>Details</strong> tab has a <strong>More information</strong> button (visually represented by a white lowercase “i” in a grey circle. When clicked, each will open the <strong>References</strong> tab, with generic details about that check.</p><p>Each icon within a section is actually a button, when clicked it will scroll the item into view and add a dotted line around it. To view the code for that particular element, at the bottom of the page, there is a <strong>Code</strong> button, visually it is represented as white text &lt;/&gt; Code, with a green background. This opens a source code viewer and by clicking any of the icon buttons in the <strong>details</strong> tab, it will highlight that specific piece of code.</p><p>By using the <strong>More information</strong> button, to get the <strong>Reference</strong> details and the source code viewer, we can determine what is wrong with the code in question, alternatively, WAVE actually adds these icons over the page, so you can click each individual icon to highlight that code in the source code panel.</p><p>The <strong>Structure</strong> tab displays the structural content of the page such as heading hierarchy and landmarks. This enables us to check, at a glance that:</p><ul><li>The expected landmarks are present, most sites should have a <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> (or <code>role=”banner”</code>), a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> (or <code>role=”navigation”</code>), a <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> (or <code>role=”main”</code>) and a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> (or <code>role=”contentinfo”</code>). There are of course other roles that assist users in quickly navigating to areas of interest</li><li>Additionally, it is also possible to check the heading hierarchy, it’s important to some users that headings are marked up using the correct <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> through to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> tags and that they’re in a logical order. A page should always have a <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, major sections would have <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>s, subsections <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>s and so forth.</li></ul><p>Finally, there is the <strong>Contrast</strong> tab, which contains WebAIM’s Color Contrast Checker and allows for a foreground and background colour’s hex values to be input and it will calculate the contrast between those values. If there are any automatically detected errors, there will be a <strong>Very low contrast [issue number]</strong> image for each. This can be clicked with a mouse/finger, which will scroll the offending item into view, this element sadly isn’t keyboard focusable, so keyboard users would need to tab into the main page and locate it manually, which may be quite difficult on larger pages, with lots of issues.</p><div class="cms__anchor-wrapper"><h2 id="arc-toolkit" tabindex="-1">Arc Toolkit</h2><a class="cms__anchor" href="#arc-toolkit" aria-labelledby="arc-toolkit"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="32" width="32" viewBox="4 14 40 20"><path d="M22.5 34H14q-4.2 0-7-3t-3-7q0-4.2 3-7t7-3h8.5v3H14q-2.9 0-5 2-2 2.1-2 5t2 5q2.1 2 5 2h8.5Zm-6.3-8.5v-3h15.6v3Zm9.3 8.5v-3H34q2.9 0 5-2 2-2.1 2-5t-2-5q-2.1-2-5-2h-8.5v-3H34q4.2 0 7 3t3 7q0 4.2-3 7t-7 3Z"></path></svg></a></div><p>Arc is only available with Chrome, although it can be downloaded to other Chromium-based browsers, I added it to MS Edge using this process:</p><p><strong>Please note:</strong> ARC is being a little buggy, right now, so this guide is incomplete.</p><ol><li>With Edge open, navigate to <a href="https://www.tpgi.com/arc-platform/arc-toolkit/">TPGi ARC Toolkit</a></li><li>Locate and click the <strong>Download ARC Toolkit</strong> button (it does have a version number, but I have omitted that, in case it has an update.

Many accessibility issues are related to poorly formed HTML, such as missing required child tags, duplicate IDs, incorrect nesting, lack of semantics or ARIA alternatives and much more. If a page is well structured, uses the correct tag for the job and uses HTML to the spec, this goes a very long way towards creating accessible interfaces, sure we can introduce new issues with CSS, JavaScript or even ARIA, but if we get that foundation right and then add the other technologies to enhance the page, whilst considering the effects of our design, development or content choices on all users, we can open up our web apps to a wider range of people.</p><ul><li>I tend to use ARC toolkit to send a page to the Validator</li><li>The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm">Web Developer extension for Chrome</a> can also send the DOM to the validator</li></ul><p>Or, <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">if you access the Validator</a> itself, there are options to <strong>Validate by URI</strong>, <strong>Validate by File upload</strong> or <strong>Validate by Direct Input</strong> (paste the page source into the validator, if you choose this approach, it may be easier to right click, select <strong>View page source</strong> and then copy the entire contents of your newly opened browser tab and paste into the validator's <strong>Direct input</strong> input).</p><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="/guideImg/CGRwGkeH6k-300.webp 300w, /guideImg/CGRwGkeH6k-600.webp 600w, /guideImg/CGRwGkeH6k-900.webp 900w" sizes="100vw"><source type="image/png" srcset="/guideImg/CGRwGkeH6k-300.png 300w, /guideImg/CGRwGkeH6k-600.png 600w, /guideImg/CGRwGkeH6k-900.png 900w" sizes="100vw"><img class="guide__image" decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of the HTML validator, displaying the 3 tabs for testing a page, Validate by URI, Validate by File Upload and Validate by Direct Input" src="/guideImg/CGRwGkeH6k-300.png" width="900" height="427"></picture></p><p>There are some errors that don’t affect accessibility, but for any developer interested in accessibility, standards, performance or SEO, the aim should always be no errors detected.</p><div class="cms__anchor-wrapper"><h2 id="wrapping-up" tabindex="-1">Wrapping up</h2><a class="cms__anchor" href="#wrapping-up" aria-labelledby="wrapping-up"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="32" width="32" viewBox="4 14 40 20"><path d="M22.5 34H14q-4.2 0-7-3t-3-7q0-4.2 3-7t7-3h8.5v3H14q-2.9 0-5 2-2 2.1-2 5t2 5q2.1 2 5 2h8.5Zm-6.3-8.5v-3h15.6v3Zm9.3 8.5v-3H34q2.9 0 5-2 2-2.1 2-5t-2-5q-2.1-2-5-2h-8.5v-3H34q4.2 0 7 3t3 7q0 4.2-3 7t-7 3Z"></path></svg></a></div><p>There are an abundance of tools out there, for testing webpages, these are just some of the semi-automated ones, there are lots more to discuss too. I personally do not use all of these tools on a single site, the reason for this is:</p><p>Most of them use Axe Core anyway, but the actual Axe extension gets the updates much quicker, so I personally use the following:</p><ul><li>Axe as my primary Accessibility checker</li><li>Accessibility Insights to check landmarks, heading structure and tab stops</li><li>ARC Toolkit to check Text Spacing, page Reflow and send the DOM to the HTML Validator</li></ul><p>I use other tools, but mostly web-based or bookmarklets, which I’ll outline in another guide. Different practitioners will prefer a different selection of tools, I use the automated tools quite late in my testing process, as I like to use the DevTools to inspect the code and perform manual tests, I then run Axe at the end, to check whether I found everything it can detect, but this is something that helps me to make testing a little personal challenge, it’s not quite Garry Kasparov vs a supercomputer, but I like that little bit of satisfaction I get if I find everything Axe does before I run it, obviously it beats me from time to time, and detects something I missed, which helps me to improve for next time.</p><p>So, semi-automated tools are very useful, no 2 work the same and no 2 yield the same issues, there are often some deviations in their results. But, always remember, that these tools can’t catch everything, a lot depends on manual testing and even more depends on testing with users that have disabilities (assuming you offer them remuneration for their time, of course).</p></article><div class="socials__container" role="group" aria-labelledby="shareTitle"><h2 class="socials__title" id="shareTitle">Share on:</h2><a href="//twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Semi-automated%20accessibility%20testing%20tools%20&url=https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/semi-automated-accessibility-testing-tools/" class="socials__link" target="_blank"><svg role="img" focusable="false" aria-label="Twitter" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M22.46 6c-.77.35-1.6.58-2.46.69a4.3 4.3 0 0 0 1.88-2.38c-.83.5-1.75.85-2.72 1.05a4.28 4.28 0 0 0-7.32 3.91A12.2 12.2 0 0 1 3 4.79a4.24 4.24 0 0 0 1.33 5.71c-.71 0-1.37-.2-1.95-.5v.03a4.3 4.3 0 0 0 3.44 4.21 4.22 4.22 0 0 1-1.93.07 4.28 4.28 0 0 0 4 2.98 8.52 8.52 0 0 1-5.33 1.84c-.34 0-.68-.02-1.02-.06A12.14 12.14 0 0 0 8.12 21C16 21 20.33 14.46 20.33 8.79l-.01-.56A8.57 8.57 0 0 0 22.46 6Z"/></svg><span class="visually-hidden">Opens in new tab</span></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/semi-automated-accessibility-testing-tools/&title=Semi-automated%20accessibility%20testing%20tools%20" class="socials__link" target="_blank"><svg role="img" focusable="false" aria-label="LinkedIn" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M1 2.84A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 2.84 1h18.32A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 23 2.84v18.32A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 21.16 23H2.84A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 1 21.16V2.84Zm8.7 6.55h2.99v1.5c.43-.87 1.53-1.64 3.18-1.64 3.17 0 3.92 1.71 3.92 4.86v5.82h-3.2v-5.1c0-1.8-.44-2.8-1.53-2.8-1.51 0-2.14 1.08-2.14 2.8v5.1H9.7V9.39Zm-5.5 10.4h3.22V9.25H4.2v10.54ZM7.88 5.81a2.06 2.06 0 1 1-4.12 0 2.06 2.06 0 0 1 4.13 0Z" clip-rule="evenodd"/></svg><span class="visually-hidden">Opens in new tab</span></a></div><aside class="author-bio"><h2 class="author-bio__title">About Darren</h2><div class="author-bio__intro"><p>Darren is both a digital accessibility analyst and a frontend web developer who focuses on building accessible, performant and intuitive websites.
