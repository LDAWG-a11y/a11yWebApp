This should include a description of how the supplier plans to test the final product against WCAG success criteria, tooling used, their audit process or the audit process of the subcontractor they may involve for external testing.

You may receive anything including</p><ul><li>no answers at all</li><li>accessibility is not on their roadmap</li><li>They have not done any testing to check compliance</li><li>No one has ever asked about this before (including “you are the first Council/Uni/College/etc. to ask for this”)</li><li>We are on X framework (such as Crown Commercial Services frameworks) so we must be fine, no further evidence supplied.</li></ul><p>If a tender response cannot provide any information to show that they are aware of the legal accessibility requirements for their customer base and know how to deal with requests and have appropriate evidence, then they are significantly higher risk.</p><p>Remember that we all first learn about accessibility at some point. For many suppliers, this might be the first time they are being made aware of the requirements. The important thing is how the supplier responde to these requirements. If they approach it proactively and try to make fixes and are operating in good faith then that is one thing, but conversely they may dismiss the need because it has been &quot;unimportant&quot; up till now. The supplier's direction from this point is important.</p><div class="callout__tip"><span class="callout__icon"></span><span class="callout__text">Remember, you as the public sector body hold all the legal responsibility. If a supplier that does not know what they are doing delivers you an illegal product, you are responsible if something goes wrong.</span></div><h3><a href=""></a>“Our product fully complies”</h3><p>Many suppliers will claim that the product they are trying to sell you fully complies with all WCAG A and AA success criteria. In our experience this is in almost every case, incorrect.</p><div class="callout__warn"><span class="callout__icon"></span><span class="callout__text">If a supplier says this in the tender response, you should be immediately sceptical. Any large or complex product will almost never be fully compliant just on the size alone.</span></div><p>Most times we have seen this response provided; the supplier will answer following questions explaining that there are a limited number of areas where the product has current issues against WCAG. This might be in a written response to one of the tender questions or can be identified through documentation such as a VPAT or audit report as mentioned below.</p><p>If you receive a response from a supplier which says “fully compliant” and then receive documentation which does not say they are 100% perfect, you should immediately raise this inconsistency and be sceptical of their documentation. Consider:</p><ul><li>Who wrote the report?</li><li>Was it in-house or a reputable 3rd party auditor</li><li>To what extent the supplier understand and can meet your requirements if they are making such contradictory statements.</li></ul><p>If you receive documentation which shows a clean slate for accessibility, also be sceptical and ask to be able to do your own testing. As has been said, most of the time, any suitably large system will not be perfect, and sometimes that has to be accepted but you are looking for an accurate state of the system not clean documentation just to get past the check.</p><h3>Using an overlay to maintain compliance</h3><p>More and more we are seeing suppliers state that they are using an &quot;overlay&quot; product to deliver accessibility for their service. Overlay products are touted as additional plugins which you add onto your website or service which will then adjust pages to make them WCAG compliant without you having to test and remediate issues. These are false claims.</p><p>If you want to find out more about overlays, why we do not support their use, and how to respond to suppliers who use overlays read our <a href="https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/overlays-and-other-fix-it-products/">overlay guide</a>.</p><h3>VPAT</h3><p>VPATs are a type of document which provides a very basic level of information on the accessibility of a digital product. This will normally be in the form of a table listing each of the WCAG success criteria an identification of their compliance, and some notes. VPAT's are part of the American Section 508 requirements, but have become an internationally used piece of accessibility documentation.</p><p>The problem with VPATs is that they are normally not detailed enough to give useful information on the true level of impact for a service.</p><p>For example, a VPAT may say for a digital system that it partially complies with 2.1.1 Keyboard (A). The notes read “Some areas of the product are not accessible to all keyboard controls”.</p><p>The question you should be asking is what does “some” mean? Is it the main navigation for the platform? Is it all main content? Or is it a logo in the footer?</p><p>If the navigation is not accessible or the main content is not accessible but other content is, then that still counts as some but would mean that a wide range of users would not be able to interact with the product at all.</p><p>If you receive a VPAT that includes vague statements such as the above, which could mean a potential massive risk, or you are not sure, ask the supplier for more detailed information on the exact areas of the product that the issue covers, and refuse to sign any contract until you see a more detailed list. A VPAT can only have been produced correctly following in-depth testing. They are summary documents and so the detailed test results must exist.</p><p>You should also be asking for a detailed remediation roadmap. If they are already aware of several issues as detailed in their VPAT, ask them for evidence of how they are planning to fix those identified issues. If they have no answer, refuse to sign a contract until they do.</p><h3>Other detailed auditing documentation</h3><p>If the supplier responds with detailed testing documentation for the product you should look through the documents carefully.</p><p>You will want to look at:</p><ul><li>How they have tested the product</li><li>What tools they have used</li><li>Is there a mix between manual, automated and assistive technology testing</li><li>How large was the scope of testing</li><li>How serious the issues are or if the descriptions are vague</li><li>What priority ratings they have given for issues</li></ul><p>If there are any issues present in the detailed documentation you should ask for a detailed remediation roadmap. If they are already aware of several issues as detailed in their detailed documentation, ask them for evidence of how they are planning to fix those identified issues. If they have no answer, refuse to sign a contract until they do.</p><h3>Accessibility Statement</h3><p>The accessibility statement is the end of the documentation journey. If the supplier can provide you with an accessibility statement, this is an insight into their testing process. If the statement is good, and has useful information on issues and even suggested workarounds already this could be a positive sign.</p><p>If the statement is poor and does not include specific information about technical issues and their affects on users, but instead includes vapid statements about &quot;commitments to support all users&quot; this could be a sign that they do not have meaningful practical documentation to back this up and show what actions they are taking to deliver on those commitments.</p><p>In either case, if an accessibility statement is provided as the main piece of evidence you should respond asking for other detailed auditing documentation which must have been used to create a good accessibility statement, or is what is required in the event a poor statement is provided, which is not enough to proceed by itself.</p><h3>Remediation roadmaps</h3><p>In the event that you receive detailed documentation from a supplier that includes identifying issues as well as remediation roadmaps which go into detail about when each issue is planned to be fixed, this is an excellent response and should show that the supplier is aware of issues with their product, are working to fix them and can provide you as the customer with significant evidence to support due diligence.</p><h3>Plans for testing</h3><p>Sometimes, particularly with new products that are either being designed bespoke for you or are a new launch from the supplier, thorough testing and road mapping may not yet have taken place. In this case you would expect to see information from the supplier about how they plan to test the product and what they will do about issues found during that testing.</p><p>Ideally you will be looking for suppliers to commit to testing against the latest WCAG A &amp; AA success criteria as a minimum. This can be done either in house if they have the skills, or by a subcontractor such as professional accessibility auditing companies. In any case the testing should include:</p><ul><li><p>A significant scope which covers the majority of components across a platform through a representative sample</p></li><li><p>A mix of manual, automated and assistive technology testing.</p><ul><li>Manual testing is required to confirm several WCAG criteria that can only be done with human judgement such as whether things are correct in context.</li><li>Automated testing tools can be used to deal with repeat issues that are easier to check with a computer such as comparing colour values for contrast, rather than trying to guess by eye.</li><li>Assistive technology testing is vital to check that the platform works with common assistive technology and operating system pairings. This would include checking with common screen readers, dictation software, magnification techniques and non-pointer input devices such as keyboard controls.</li></ul></li><li><p>A prioritisation of issues based on impact to users</p></li><li><p>Recommendations on how to fix issues. This may be more present in common easy to fix issues, rather than more complex issues for significant components which may require replacement.</p></li></ul><div class="cms__anchor-wrapper"><h2 id="post-procurement-and-contracts" tabindex="-1">Post procurement and contracts</h2><a class="cms__anchor" href="#post-procurement-and-contracts" aria-labelledby="post-procurement-and-contracts"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="32" width="32" viewBox="4 14 40 20"><path d="M22.5 34H14q-4.2 0-7-3t-3-7q0-4.2 3-7t7-3h8.5v3H14q-2.9 0-5 2-2 2.1-2 5t2 5q2.1 2 5 2h8.5Zm-6.3-8.5v-3h15.6v3Zm9.3 8.5v-3H34q2.9 0 5-2 2-2.1 2-5t-2-5q-2.1-2-5-2h-8.5v-3H34q4.2 0 7 3t3 7q0 4.2-3 7t-7 3Z"></path></svg></a></div><p>Once you have completed your tendering process and have decided to enter into an agreement with a supplier, it is important to keep accessibility compliance in the requirements.</p><p>The best way to do this is to include accessibility into contracts with suppliers.

For several years George's focus has been on the delivery of accessible and inclusive services for all citizens. Known for his extensive knowledge on UK accessibility legislation, he is the author of the original accessibility statement monitoring in Europe and his work on both statements and disproportionate burden misuse has been discussed by the European Commission as an exemplar for delivering accessibility for public services. His years of involvement with academia have seen George guest lecturing about accessibility as part of Computer Science curriculums and help set best practice for accessibility in educational materials. Now taking on new challenges in the education sector, George is working with the British Computing Society to develop the Digital Accessibility Specialist Degree Apprenticeship Curriculum. In his spare time George studies for a PhD to develop improvements for tactile maps used in navigation.</p></div><dl class="author-bio__meta"><div class="author-bio__items-wrapper"><dt class="author-bio__term">Position:</dt><dd class="author-bio__description">Digital Accessibility Lead</dd></div><div class="author-bio__items-wrapper"><dt class="author-bio__term">Organisation:</dt><dd class="author-bio__description">University of Westminster</dd></div><div class="author-bio__items-wrapper"><dt class="author-bio__term"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M22.46 6c-.77.35-1.6.58-2.46.69a4.3 4.3 0 0 0 1.88-2.38c-.83.5-1.75.85-2.72 1.05a4.28 4.28 0 0 0-7.32 3.91A12.2 12.2 0 0 1 3 4.79a4.24 4.24 0 0 0 1.33 5.71c-.71 0-1.37-.2-1.95-.5v.03a4.3 4.3 0 0 0 3.44 4.21 4.22 4.22 0 0 1-1.93.07 4.28 4.28 0 0 0 4 2.98 8.52 8.52 0 0 1-5.33 1.84c-.34 0-.68-.02-1.02-.06A12.14 12.14 0 0 0 8.12 21C16 21 20.33 14.46 20.33 8.79l-.01-.56A8.57 8.57 0 0 0 22.46 6Z"/></svg></dt><dd class="author-bio__description"><a href="https://twitter.com/Access_Rhodes" class="author-bio__link">@Access_Rhodes</a></dd></div><div class="author-bio__items-wrapper"><dt class="author-bio__term"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M1 2.84A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 2.84 1h18.32A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 23 2.84v18.32A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 21.16 23H2.84A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 1 21.16V2.84Zm8.7 6.55h2.99v1.5c.43-.87 1.53-1.64 3.18-1.64 3.17 0 3.92 1.71 3.92 4.86v5.82h-3.2v-5.1c0-1.8-.44-2.8-1.53-2.8-1.51 0-2.14 1.08-2.14 2.8v5.1H9.7V9.39Zm-5.5 10.4h3.22V9.25H4.2v10.54ZM7.88 5.81a2.06 2.06 0 1 1-4.12 0 2.06 2.06 0 0 1 4.13 0Z" clip-rule="evenodd"/></svg></dt><dd class="author-bio__description"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-rhodes-17009593/" class="author-bio__link">/in/george-rhodes-17009593/</a></dd></div><div class="author-bio__items-wrapper"><dt class="author-bio__term"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M16.36 14c.08-.66.14-1.32.14-2 0-.68-.06-1.34-.14-2h3.38c.16.64.26 1.31.26 2s-.1 1.36-.26 2m-5.15 5.56c.6-1.11 1.06-2.31 1.38-3.56h2.95a8.03 8.03 0 0 1-4.33 3.56M14.34 14H9.66a13.27 13.27 0 0 1 0-4h4.68c.09.65.16 1.32.16 2 0 .68-.07 1.34-.16 2M12 19.96c-.83-1.2-1.5-2.53-1.91-3.96h3.82A13.56 13.56 0 0 1 12 19.96M8 8H5.08A7.92 7.92 0 0 1 9.4 4.44 17.23 17.23 0 0 0 8 8m-2.92 8H8c.35 1.25.8 2.45 1.4 3.56A8 8 0 0 1 5.08 16m-.82-2A8.24 8.24 0 0 1 4 12c0-.69.1-1.36.26-2h3.38c-.08.66-.14 1.32-.14 2 0 .68.06 1.34.14 2M12 4.03c.83 1.2 1.5 2.54 1.91 3.97h-3.82A13.62 13.62 0 0 1 12 4.03M18.92 8h-2.95a15.65 15.65 0 0 0-1.38-3.56A7.99 7.99 0 0 1 18.92 8M12 2C6.47 2 2 6.5 2 12a10 10 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 10-10A10 10 0 0 0 12 2Z"/></svg></dt><dd class="author-bio__description"><a href="allable.co.uk" class="author-bio__link">allable.co.uk</a></dd></div></dl></aside></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__contact-us"><h2 data-no-accent>Contact us</h2><div class="flex__middle"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M22.46 6c-.77.35-1.6.58-2.46.69a4.3 4.3 0 0 0 1.88-2.38c-.83.5-1.75.85-2.72 1.05a4.28 4.28 0 0 0-7.32 3.91A12.2 12.2 0 0 1 3 4.79a4.24 4.24 0 0 0 1.33 5.71c-.71 0-1.37-.2-1.95-.5v.03a4.3 4.3 0 0 0 3.44 4.21 4.22 4.22 0 0 1-1.93.07 4.28 4.28 0 0 0 4 2.98 8.52 8.52 0 0 1-5.33 1.84c-.34 0-.68-.02-1.02-.06A12.14 12.14 0 0 0 8.12 21C16 21 20.33 14.46 20.33 8.79l-.01-.56A8.57 8.57 0 0 0 22.46 6Z"/></svg> <a class="footer__link" href="https://twitter.com/MTAccessible?s=20&t=x69yq8wMBQ4y5j6byafhyw" class="">Find us on Twitter</a></div><div class="flex__middle"><svg focusable="false" aria-hidden="true" width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="m20 8-8 5-8-5V6l8 5 8-5m0-2H4a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v12a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h16a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V6a2 2 0 0 0-2-2Z"/></svg> <span class="visually-hidden">Email: </span><a class="footer__link" href="mailto:info@makethingsaccessible.com">info@makethingsaccessible.com</a></div></div><div class="footer__help"><h2 data-no-accent>Need help?</h2><p class="footer__help-text">If you have trouble with accessing any part of our site or links, please let us know and one of our experienced team will identify and resolve the problem.
