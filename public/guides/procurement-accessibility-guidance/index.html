We have an equal duty to not discriminate against members of the public or our staff because of disability. We do this by making sure all the products we buy meet the required standards, with clear evidence to support compliance with our legal responsibilities.</p><p>Getting accessibility right during the tendering and procurement process is vital as it helps us fulfil our legal requirements from the very start and prevents 'buying into problems'.</p><p>There are many complexities when it comes to regulation responsibilities and 3rd parties. We have more information on these complexities in our <a href="https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/3rd-party-content-responsibilities/">3rd party content responsibilities guide</a>.</p><p>The intent of this guide is for you to be able to use the following example digital accessibility requirements in tender and technical or functional requirements documentation when procuring Software as a Service (SaaS) products.</p><p>SaaS can cover a wide variety of digital purchases (and range of included content) such as commissioning a new website, the production of digital documents for marketing campaigns, 3rd party applications, mobile apps, or systems, and other digital content.</p><h3>Coverage</h3><p>The requirement to be accessible applies to both for front-end (customer, students, members of the public) and back-end (staff) aspects of systems and services. This means that we need to ensure that the entirety of the service is accessible, including the following:</p><ul><li>external facing screens;</li><li>internal facing screens;</li><li>administration facing screens;</li><li>password verification systems;</li><li>authentication processes; and</li><li>all communications, including emails, generated document formats, confirmation user action, receipt of acknowledgment, requests, additional correspondence, requests for further information, and use of third-party plugins.</li></ul><h3>Relevant Regulations and Standards</h3><p>When receiving responses from suppliers, they may reference different standards depending on where they are based. It is good to understand the following relevant regulations and standards to accessibility in procurement and the information different compliance documentation may contain. The list below is a quick reference of some of the key requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>PSBAR</strong> – <a href="https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/what-are-the-public-sector-bodies-accessibility-regulations/">Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (PSBAR)</a> which requires evidence of compliance with WCAG 2.2 and an <a href="https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/accessibility-statements-what-are-they/">accessibility statement</a>.</li><li><strong><a href="%E2%80%A2%09EU%20Web%20Accessibility%20Directive">EU Web Accessibility Directive</a></strong> – The EU equivalent of PSBAR. Differs between EU members states but all require evidence of compliance with WCAG (under the banner of the EN 301 549 harmonised standard) and an accessibility statement.</li><li><strong><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202#:~:text=The%20European%20accessibility%20act%20is,EU%20leading%20to%20costs%20reduction">EU Accessibility Act 2019</a></strong> – Will require evidence of compliance with WCAG 2.1 or better and other standards for physical accessibility for electrical hardware as well.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.section508.gov/">Section 508</a></strong> – The American standards which require evidence of WCAG compliance for 2.0 or better. Is evidenced through a VPAT.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG</a></strong> – The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. The underlying technical standards that all others refer back to.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/">ATAG</a></strong> – The Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines. A subset of WCAG requirements and additional points focussed on accessible authoring tools.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf">EN 301 549</a></strong> – The European harmonised standard which aligns WCAG requirements with a wider range of formats including documents.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.section508.gov/sell/vpat/">VPAT</a></strong> – A type of WCAG checklist used to evidence levels of compliance under Section 508. Originally an American thing but have become more of a common widespread document.</li></ul><h3>General guidance</h3><p>We recommend where possible, you involve your organisations digital accessibility officers in the review of any supplier responses received during a procurement exercise. It is important to get the feedback of accessibility professionals to be able to correctly judge the quality of documentation provided by suppliers.</p><p>For example, if a supplier provides an accessibility roadmap it should be reviewed by an appropriate accessibility professional outside the project. They weigh up the potential user impact, proposed mitigations, and consider the availability of alternative products. They may approve or not; approval may be subject to specific mitigations being implemented as a prerequisite to purchase.</p><p>If you do not have accessibility specialists to review your supplier responses, please refer to our <a href="https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/reviewing-procurement-responses-for-accessibility/">Reviewing procurement responses guide</a> which give some suggestions on what you should be looking for in different response and documentation types.</p><div class="callout__warn"><span class="callout__icon"></span><span class="callout__text">This publication is issued as guidance only.

Depending on what kind of SaaS product you are procuring, you should include the following in the tender requirements. In the sections below we describe requirements for the following types of SaaS procurement:</p><ol><li>Supplier is offering to create a system to your specification</li><li>Supplier is offering their own product that will be “customised” to your requirements</li><li>Supplier is offering a Commercial Off the Shelf (COtS) Product</li></ol><h3>Download template requirements</h3><ol><li><a href="/docs/option-1-bespoke-system-requirements.docx">Option 1 - bespoke system requirements</a></li><li><a href="/docs/option-2-customised-system-requirements.docx">Option 2 - customised system requirements</a></li><li><a href="/docs/option-3-cots-requirements.docx">Option 3 - COTS requirements</a></li></ol><h3>Option 1: Supplier is offering to create a system to your specification</h3><p>If a supplier is offering to create a system to your specification, they will not necessarily be able to provide you with documentation for a system’s compliance at the tender stage but should instead provide clear detail about how they plan to develop your system to accessibility standards and how they plan to test and evidence this compliance. For this situation we suggest using the following set of requirements:</p><ol><li><strong>Describe how the supplier will ensure the proposed solution (customer and staff facing) shall meet compliance with the latest published version of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG</a> (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) (currently 2.2) A and AA success criteria, in line with regulation requirements and international best practice.</strong> This should include a description of how the supplier plans to test the final product against WCAG success criteria, tooling used, their audit process or the audit process of the subcontractor they may involve for external testing. This should also include any information regarding how they would roadmap fixes if the final product is not compliant.</li><li><strong>Describe how the solution will support accessible content creation and upload compliance with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG</a> where relevant.</strong> For example, what restrictions, options, or guidance the solution will implement to help content creators upload or write accessible content.</li><li><strong>Describe how the solution will support disabled staff in using authoring tools to create content in compliance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/">ATAG</a> (Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines 2.0).</strong> For example, how will internal screens function with keyboard controls and assistive technologies like screen readers or dictation software to ensure staff can navigate and interact with internal functions.</li><li><strong>The supplier will indicate if in the delivery of the solution they are using or plan to use any products provided by companies listed in the <a href="https://overlayfactsheet.com/#main">Overlay Fact Sheet</a>, or any other products that fit the description below.</strong> Overlay and Underlay products/plugins/add-ons which offer to remediate accessibility issues represent a false approach to accessibility compliance and can present legal and reputational risks to both the supplier and customer. It is important to be clear on where and what the supplier is using overlay products for because <a href="https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/overlays-and-other-fix-it-products/">overlay products cannot be used for regulation compliance</a>.</li><li><strong>The supplier agrees to works with the customer to produce an accessibility statement for the proposed solution</strong> which meets customer legislative obligation as a public sector body under PSBAR (2018) and is acceptable to the customer. The prerequisite (REQ 1) being that the supplier obtains sufficient evidence of WCAG compliance testing from which to draw details required for the accessibility statement.</li><li><strong>The supplier agrees to work with the customer to provide guidance for assistive technology users.</strong> Guidance material required in all cases; additional guidance required to navigate areas of non-compliance with WCAG if present.</li><li><strong>Describe how the supplier will ensure that any related content shall meet compliance with the content relevant success criteria in the latest published version of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG</a> (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) (currently 2.2) and detailed in <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/01.01.02_60/en_301549v010102p.pdf">EN 301 549</a>, in line with regulation requirements and international best practice.</strong> This should cover any content generated by the system, or related to the promotion, use, or management of the system, including all communications, emails, generated document formats, confirmation user action, receipt of acknowledgment, requests, additional correspondence, requests for further information, and use of third-party plugins.</li></ol><h3>Option 2: Supplier is offering their own product that will be “customised” to your requirements</h3><p>If a supplier is offering their own product that will be “customised” to your requirements, they should be able to provide compliance documentation for a “default” version of the platform and be able to clarify how much customisation they offer to customers, and what impacts that may have on accessibility compliance and how they support mitigating those risks during the implementation process. For this situation we suggest using the following set of requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Describe how the supplier will ensure the proposed solution (customer and staff facing) shall meet and maintain compliance with the latest published version of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG</a> (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) (currently 2.2) A and AA success criteria, in line with regulation requirements and international best practice.</strong> Supplier to provide test reports to evidence how they meet / don't meet WCAG compliance including listing test tooling used, their audit process or the audit process of the subcontractor they may involve for external testing. For example, a detailed WCAG audit report, VPAT, evidence of assistive technology testing or user testing with disabled user groups. Supplier to also provide their development roadmap for accessibility if their product partially complies, and how they plan to test and maintain compliance in future.</li><li><strong>Describe levels of customisations available to the customer in terms of themes, GUI, and functionality.</strong> Supplier should explain what impacts customisations may have on accessibility compliance and how the supplier supports customers to check for and mitigating accessibility risks being introduced during the implementation process. For example, does the supplier maintain guidance on how to implement GUI or theme changes to maintain colour or magnification requirements, or components list and their known accessibility issues so that customers can choose only accessible components before implementation.</li><li><strong>Describe how the solution supports accessible content creation and upload compliance with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG</a> where relevant.</strong> For example, what restrictions, options, or guidance the solution includes to help content creators upload or write accessible content.</li><li><strong>Describe how the solution supports disabled staff in using authoring tools to create content in compliance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/">ATAG</a> (Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines 2.0).</strong> For example, how do internal screens function with keyboard controls and assistive technologies like screen readers or dictation software to ensure staff can navigate and interact with internal functions.</li><li><strong>The supplier will indicate if in the delivery of the solution they are using or plan to use any products provided by companies listed in the <a href="https://overlayfactsheet.com/#main">Overlay Fact Sheet</a>, or any other products that fit the description below.</strong> Overlay and Underlay products/plugins/add-ons which offer to remediate accessibility issues represent a false approach to accessibility compliance and can present legal and reputational risks to both the supplier and customer.

Or the supplier agrees to works with the customer to produce an accessibility statement for the proposed solution which meets customer legislative obligation as a public sector body under PSBAR (2018) and is acceptable to the customer. The prerequisite (REQ1) being that the supplier has sufficient evidence of WCAG compliance testing from which to draw details required for the accessibility statement.</li><li><strong>The supplier provides / works with the customer to provide guidance for assistive technology users.</strong> Guidance material required in all cases; additional guidance required to navigate areas of non-compliance with WCAG if present.</li><li><strong>Describe how the supplier will ensure that any related content shall meet compliance with the content relevant success criteria in the latest published version of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG</a> (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) (currently 2.2) and detailed in <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/01.01.02_60/en_301549v010102p.pdf">EN 301 549</a>, in line with regulation requirements and international best practice.</strong> This should cover any content generated by the system, or related to the promotion, use, or management of the system, including all communications, emails, generated document formats, confirmation user action, receipt of acknowledgment, requests, additional correspondence, requests for further information, and use of third-party plugins.</li></ul><h3>Option 3: Supplier is offering a Commercial Off the Shelf (COtS) Product</h3><p>If a supplier is offering their own product with no customisations, they should be able to provide compliance documentation for the platform, including their testing processes, tools they use, and how they fix known issues and maintain high accessibility standards. For this situation we suggest using the following set of requirements:</p><ol><li><strong>Describe how the supplier will ensure the proposed solution (customer and staff facing) shall meet and maintain compliance with the latest published version of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">WCAG</a> (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) (currently 2.2) A and AA success criteria, in line with regulation requirements and international best practice.</strong> Supplier to provide test reports to evidence how they meet / don't meet WCAG compliance including listing test tooling used, their audit process or the audit process of the subcontractor they may involve for external testing.

For several years George's focus has been on the delivery of accessible and inclusive services for all citizens. Known for his extensive knowledge on UK accessibility legislation, he is the author of the original accessibility statement monitoring in Europe and his work on both statements and disproportionate burden misuse has been discussed by the European Commission as an exemplar for delivering accessibility for public services. His years of involvement with academia have seen George guest lecturing about accessibility as part of Computer Science curriculums and help set best practice for accessibility in educational materials. Now taking on new challenges in the education sector, George is working with the British Computing Society to develop the Digital Accessibility Specialist Degree Apprenticeship Curriculum. In his spare time George studies for a PhD to develop improvements for tactile maps used in navigation.</p></div><dl class="author-bio__meta"><div class="author-bio__items-wrapper"><dt class="author-bio__term">Position:</dt><dd class="author-bio__description">Digital Accessibility Lead</dd></div><div class="author-bio__items-wrapper"><dt class="author-bio__term">Organisation:</dt><dd class="author-bio__description">University of Westminster</dd></div><div class="author-bio__items-wrapper"><dt class="author-bio__term"><svg role="img" focusable="false" aria-label="Twitter" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M22.46 6c-.77.35-1.6.58-2.46.69a4.3 4.3 0 0 0 1.88-2.38c-.83.5-1.75.85-2.72 1.05a4.28 4.28 0 0 0-7.32 3.91A12.2 12.2 0 0 1 3 4.79a4.24 4.24 0 0 0 1.33 5.71c-.71 0-1.37-.2-1.95-.5v.03a4.3 4.3 0 0 0 3.44 4.21 4.22 4.22 0 0 1-1.93.07 4.28 4.28 0 0 0 4 2.98 8.52 8.52 0 0 1-5.33 1.84c-.34 0-.68-.02-1.02-.06A12.14 12.14 0 0 0 8.12 21C16 21 20.33 14.46 20.33 8.79l-.01-.56A8.57 8.57 0 0 0 22.46 6Z"/></svg></dt><dd class="author-bio__description"><a href="https://twitter.com/Access_Rhodes" class="author-bio__link">@Access_Rhodes</a></dd></div><div class="author-bio__items-wrapper"><dt class="author-bio__term"><svg role="img" focusable="false" aria-label="LinkedIn" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M1 2.84A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 2.84 1h18.32A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 23 2.84v18.32A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 21.16 23H2.84A1.84 1.84 0 0 1 1 21.16V2.84Zm8.7 6.55h2.99v1.5c.43-.87 1.53-1.64 3.18-1.64 3.17 0 3.92 1.71 3.92 4.86v5.82h-3.2v-5.1c0-1.8-.44-2.8-1.53-2.8-1.51 0-2.14 1.08-2.14 2.8v5.1H9.7V9.39Zm-5.5 10.4h3.22V9.25H4.2v10.54ZM7.88 5.81a2.06 2.06 0 1 1-4.12 0 2.06 2.06 0 0 1 4.13 0Z" clip-rule="evenodd"/></svg></dt><dd class="author-bio__description"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-rhodes-17009593/" class="author-bio__link">/in/george-rhodes-17009593/</a></dd></div><div class="author-bio__items-wrapper"><dt class="author-bio__term"><svg role="img" focusable="false" aria-label="Website" width="24px" height="24px" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M16.36 14c.08-.66.14-1.32.14-2 0-.68-.06-1.34-.14-2h3.38c.16.64.26 1.31.26 2s-.1 1.36-.26 2m-5.15 5.56c.6-1.11 1.06-2.31 1.38-3.56h2.95a8.03 8.03 0 0 1-4.33 3.56M14.34 14H9.66a13.27 13.27 0 0 1 0-4h4.68c.09.65.16 1.32.16 2 0 .68-.07 1.34-.16 2M12 19.96c-.83-1.2-1.5-2.53-1.91-3.96h3.82A13.56 13.56 0 0 1 12 19.96M8 8H5.08A7.92 7.92 0 0 1 9.4 4.44 17.23 17.23 0 0 0 8 8m-2.92 8H8c.35 1.25.8 2.45 1.4 3.56A8 8 0 0 1 5.08 16m-.82-2A8.24 8.24 0 0 1 4 12c0-.69.1-1.36.26-2h3.38c-.08.66-.14 1.32-.14 2 0 .68.06 1.34.14 2M12 4.03c.83 1.2 1.5 2.54 1.91 3.97h-3.82A13.62 13.62 0 0 1 12 4.03M18.92 8h-2.95a15.65 15.65 0 0 0-1.38-3.56A7.99 7.99 0 0 1 18.92 8M12 2C6.47 2 2 6.5 2 12a10 10 0 0 0 10 10 10 10 0 0 0 10-10A10 10 0 0 0 12 2Z"/></svg></dt><dd class="author-bio__description"><a href="https://www.allable.co.uk" class="author-bio__link">AllAble.co.uk</a></dd></div></dl></aside></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__panel--primary"><h2 class="footer__heading">Site links</h2><ul class="footer__list"><li class="footer__list-item"><a class="footer__link" href="/">Home</a></li><li class="footer__list-item"><a class="footer__link" href="/about/">About</a></li><li class="footer__list-item"><a class="footer__link" href="/guides/">Guides</a></li><li class="footer__list-item"><a class="footer__link" href="/faqs/">FAQs</a></li><li class="footer__list-item"><a class="footer__link" href="/aaa/">AAA Home</a></li><li class="footer__list-item"><a class="footer__link" href="/accessibility/">Accessibility</a></li><li class="footer__list-item"><a class="footer__link" href="/glossary/">Glossary</a></li><li class="footer__list-item"><a class="footer__link" href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li class="footer__list-item"><a class="footer__link" href="/sitemapNav/">Sitemap</a></li><li class="footer__list-item"><a class="footer__link" href="/codeOfConduct">Code of Conduct</a></li><li class="footer__list-item"><a class="footer__link" href="/contributing">Contributing</a></li><li class="footer__list-item"><a class="footer__link" href="/admin">Admin</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer__panel--secondary"><h2 class="footer__heading">Need help?</h2><p class="footer__help-text">If you have trouble with accessing any part of our site or links, please let us know and one of our experienced team will identify and resolve the problem.
