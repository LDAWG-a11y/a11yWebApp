# Welcome to Make Things Accessible

In order to contribute to our site, you would need to receive an invite, so you can login to our Content Management System, if you haven't yet received one and are part of the UK education sector, please send an email to info@makethingsaccessible.com along with a few details:

- Your first and last name (required)
- Your job title (Optional but strongly recommended you do provide it)
- Your organisation (Optional but strongly recommended you do provide it)
- A short bio, just tell us a bit about your experience and help users get to know you a little
- A profile picture (ideally this will be square 192 * 192px)
- Optional contact methods are:
  - Your Twitter handle
  - Your LinkedIn
  - Your email
  - Your website if you have one
  
  Once you send us all of those, we can create you a user account, so the guides you create are attributed to you. Just a quick heads up, we are very fortunate to have our hosting provided to us for free, by the awesome folks at Netlify and a condition of our free Open Sorce account is that we provide information on a non-commercial basis, so please ensure:
  - You do not canvas for work
  - You do not promote goods or services as part of any paid promotions
  
  It's fine to discuss software, courses and assistive tech, but not for monetary or personal gain.
