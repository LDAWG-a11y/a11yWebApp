  "bio": "<p>Darren is both a digital accessibility analyst and a frontend web developer focused on building accessible, performant and intuitive websites. Darren is the developer for this platform and was responsible for writing all the code that runs the site, he built it with an accessibility-first approach, applying all of his knowledge of accessible web interfaces through each stage of the project.</p><p>Darren is currently an accessibility analyst, at Westminster, but still likes to get his hands dirty with code whenever the opportunity arises. Darren first got involved with digital accessibility whilst in the final year of his degree, in 2017/18 and once he discovered that the quality of code and design choices could exclude people from using sites, he began to seek opportunities where he could help to put that right, by either developing inclusive components or sites or testing them and sharing his knowledge with other developers.</p>",
