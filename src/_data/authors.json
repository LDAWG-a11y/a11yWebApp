    "bio": "I am a very experienced remediator of PDFs, I am passionate about fixing documents that are saved in a file format that should really be reserved for printing. I also take great pleasure in knowing I only having one tool available, that I can actually fix the accessibility issues in, and for that, it requires me to pay extra for a pro license. I don't mind though, as I am a pro and I am at my happiest when remediating PDFs that could really have been webpages. I have authored 7 books on the history of PDFs and I am the head of the PDF appreciation society, in Cumbria. I also like cricket.",
