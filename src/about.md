  <h2>Our mission</h2>
  As digital accessibility professionals we are always asked where people can find useful resources to help with a range of accessibility questions. Make Things Accessible is the answer to that question.

  This project began as a shared effort between a number of London-based universities looking to pool our efforts and knowledge on delivering accessible experiences for students and staff. Make Things Accessible is continuing to grow with more contributors, turning this repository into a useful tool for everyone.

  The aim is to avoid the duplication of resources and create a wider pool of specialisms from which to draw expert guidance. Whether you are an accessibility professional looking for useful tools for your own organisation, or this is the first time you have heard about accessibility and want to learn the basics, we hope there is something here to help you out.
