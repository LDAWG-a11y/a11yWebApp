  <h2>Our mission</h2>
  As digital accessibility professionals we are always asked where can people find useful resources to help with a range of accessibility questions. Make Things Accessible is the answer to that question.

  This project is a shared effort between a number of London-based universities looking to pool our efforts and knowledge on delivering accessible experiences for students and staff. The aim is to avoid the duplication of resources and create a wider pool of specialisms from which to draw expert guidance.

  Whether you are an accessibility professional looking for useful tools for your own organisation, or this is the first time you have heard about accessibility and want to learn the basics, we hope there is something here to help you out.

  We will be regularly updating the website with new articles and hopefully more functionality to help guide you to the right guidance straight away. Watch this space.
