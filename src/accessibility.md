This accessibility statement applies to the makethingsaccessible.com website.

This website is run by the private individual George Rhodes and other accessibility professionals as a collaborative project to share good practice guidance material. This website is neither majority funded or managed by any public sector body.

## How accessible this website is

The website has recently undergone a significant UI update including the addition of further functionality.

The website was built by accessibility professionals with accessibility in mind throughout development and we are confident that the Make Things Accessible website will offer you an accessible experience.

With the new UI release, we have now included a range of Site preferences customisation controls to enable you to tailor your accessibility preferences. This is not a 3rd party overlay product, but a core set of tools built as part of the update to ensure we offer a smooth and integrated customisation experience.

Within the site preferences you can adjust:

- Themes (Light/Dark, and whole website/code blocks)
- Motion and animation reduction
- Improved links visibility
- Text and paragraph font sizes, letter spacing, line height, paragraph spacing and word spacing preferences.
