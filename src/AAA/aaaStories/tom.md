I am a 17-year-old student currently enrolled in a T-Level course in Digital and Creative Industries. Additionally, I am a member of the Young Voices Team within the Education Team at the Thomas Pocklington Trust.

Throughout my education, I have encountered several barriers due to my visual impairment. These challenges include the need for enlarged texts and access to a laptop or iPad for note-taking. In computing lessons, the use of two monitors has also been essential for me.

My visual impairment affects my education by limiting my ability to see from a distance. As a result, I need to sit at the front of the class and use enlarged texts and handouts.

Support for my visual impairment began in primary school, where I received enlarged texts. In secondary school and beyond, I was provided with an iPad or laptop, which significantly improved my note-taking speed and allowed me to adjust the text size as needed. The physical support I required was identified early on with the help of the visual impairment team at the council. However, it took time to discover the assistive technologies that could further aid my learning.
