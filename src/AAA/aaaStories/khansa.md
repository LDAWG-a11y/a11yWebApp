Imagine growing up in a world where you do not have access to the books you need for your classes and having to rely on others’ generosity to read them aloud to you. Imagine wanting to write but not having the tools to do so independently. This was my reality growing up.

I was in grade 9 when I finally gained access to assistive technology of my own. However, my school was not equipped to provide the training or support I needed to effectively use this technology. My journey into advocacy for assistive technology stems from this experience. As a blind individual, my access to resources is drastically limited without technology, and my potential remains unrecognized without these tools.

Access to assistive technology opened up a new world for me. I could navigate social media, watch shows with audio descriptions, read books independently, and write using screen readers. These experiences transformed how I engage with the world and deepened my commitment to ensuring others can access similar opportunities.

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in education at the University of Oxford. My hope is to use rigorous participatory research to design accessible solutions for learners from diverse backgrounds.

Being part of this campaign has been an incredible experience. Not only have I had the privilege of meeting remarkable individuals, but I’ve also had the opportunity to refine my advocacy skills and work on a cause I am deeply passionate about: addressing the lack of accessible technology for students.

Through this journey, I’ve learned something profound about myself as a learner—something that resonates universally. Any learner has the potential to succeed if they are given the right tools, environment and access to resources. Everyone learns differently, and these differences do not reflect incompetence but rather the diversity of human potential.
