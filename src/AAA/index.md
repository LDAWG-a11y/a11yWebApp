AAA is a campaign that aims to increase access to assistive technology across further education colleges as well as raising awareness of how to make resources accessible by design so they are compatible with assistive technology. The BYC's youth-led campaign group consists of 15 young regional champions from across England, along with our partners at the University College of London and the Kent and Medway Progression Federation.

## Why is this campaign needed?

Although good practice of promoting assistive technology can be found in colleges, young people at the British Youth Council highlighted some poor learning experiences they had had due to a lack of support with assistive technology in College. [Research by the Thomas Pocklington Trust](https://www.pocklington-trust.org.uk/student-support/professionals/technology-and-accessibility-in-fe-research/) evidenced that colleges are failing in their compliance with website regulations with few focussing on inclusion, accessibility and anticipatory adjustments. Follow-up research a year on has seen some improvements but 63% of accessibility statements are still poor.

<div class="accordion__panel">

Ideally content should be made in HTML on a website that has been built with accessibility in mind, however, we understand that for quite a lot of schools this is not practical, and our campaign aims to maximise accessibility for documents in all formats produced by Further Education colleges. To this end, we have the folowing guides on how to make accessible lessons in a variety of formats:

* [Here's a guide to the basics of accessible documents by Ben Watson](https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/accessible-document-basics/)
* [See this guide on how to make PDF files more accessible, and the different standards of PDF files](https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/wait-there-s-more-than-one-type-of-pdf-pdf-standards-and-how-they-differ-in-terms-of-accessibility/)
* [See this guide on making accessible lectures, tutorials and sessions by Ben Watson.](https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/accessible-lectures-tutorials-and-sessions/)

Note: The previous guide was targeted at universities, however the same principles apply to Further Education.

* [Also read this guide from Microsoft on how to make PowerPoint files more accessible to people with disabilities.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-your-powerpoint-presentations-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-6f7772b2-2f33-4bd2-8ca7-dae3b2b3ef25)
* [When making pre-recorded videos, you should also consider whether you should be including closed captioning for people who have hearing difficulties.](https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/captions-and-transcripts-for-use-in-content/)

Ensuring that your lesson materials are accessible by design not only helps people who are actively attending your lectures access the content provided to them, but also helps to future-proof the lessons, and address future accessibility needs.

<h3 class="accordion">To create a champion for accessibility who is a direct point of contact for students and parents/carers (including future students)</h3>
<div class="accordion__panel">

You should have a direct point of contact for anyone with accessibility related needs that people can go to, at any time, in confidence that their queries will be answered and requirements met. Note: Some schools may call this "SEN", "SENCO", or something entirely different.

An accessibility champion should be:

* Available for all students and parents to contact, regardless of disability status or any other characteristic through both email and visits in person.
* Have experience with assistive technology regulation, guidance, applications and implementation.
* Open to new ideas and feedback on how the organisation could improve accessibility.
* Be in direct communication with senior leadership within the organisation and able to improve accessibility issues both within the physical premises and the lessons themselves.
* Pointed out to all students so they are aware of who to talk to about any accessibilty issues or requirements, to ensure that they are met.

Having an accessiblity champion enables students to reach their full potential in their school / college, and can mean that people within the organisation are adequately equipped to succeed.

<h3 class="accordion">To promote comprehensive information about assistive technology and how to access free accessibility tools, for example signpost students to the Access and Assistance For All website</h3>
<div class="accordion__panel">

There are many forms of both physical and digital assistive technology that can aid students throughout their education, and these could potentially be of huge benefit to students, so should be promoted (even non-disabled people can benefit from assistive technology! Spellcheck, auto-complete and even basic organisational systems originated as assistive technology, and can be beneficial to all when implemented correctly) There are also sites, such as [My Computer My Way](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/), which can show you how to setup the many free digital accessibility solutions already available on most devices.

<h3 class="accordion">To use the Access and Assistance for All template to promote a <b>personalised charter</b> so that students and parents/carers are made aware of what they can ask the college for in terms of accessibility</h3>
<div class="accordion__panel">

Having a personalised charter that is spread across the school and displayed openly ensures that students are made aware of what they can have access to, and can also provide clear evidence of progress being made towards ensuring that a school or college is more accessible.

<h3 class="accordion">To require all staff to look the Access and Assistance for all webpages and read student stories, so that they can understand the importance of assistive technology and how it can benefit all students.</h3>
<div class="accordion__panel">
  
Participants in our campaign have shared stories of their experiences with using assistive technology, which provides brilliant examples of how it can benefit students and give a wider range of people equal access to education, and help level the playing field. We would advise staff members to read these, to understand the practical aspects of assistive technology.

We recognise how many demands there are on colleges and aim to make signing up to these pledges as simple as possible so we are creating resources to support the implementation of all of these pledges. In order to do this we have produced role-specific guidance as well to be able to distill the information down, and this allows people to view duties specific to their role:

[See our role-specific guidance](/aaa/roles/)

### In return for signing up to the pledges you will:

1. Take a positive and meaningful step to provide a more inclusive learning environment for all your students with better outcomes for individuals and your college as a whole
2. Be listed as a supporter, below and have the option to share any good practice that you are already doing
3. Show your commitment to improving accessibility through the use of our supportersâ€™ logo
