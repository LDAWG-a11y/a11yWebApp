    * Your name
    * You may provide links to Twitter, LinkedIn, email or your website (these are all optional)
    * You may optionally provide your current role and/or organisation
    * You will need to provide a short bio, in the form of “About me”, this can be as short as a sentence or two, but try to keep it concise
* Your content must not be commercial in nature, this site is open source and in the spirit of open source, all content is provided free, without commercialisation
* The content must be your own, you cannot copy somebody else’s content from elsewhere and pass it off as your own

* By contributing, you agree that the content belongs to the MakeThingsAccessible website, by this we mean should you at a later date wish to have your details removed from the system, we will assist you with this by anonymising all of your content and removing all references to you from the site, every effort will be made to remove your name from the GitHub repository, but as this is a public repository, we cannot guarantee that references to you will not be available in version control. If we do remove your details, we reserve the right to keep your content on the site, under an anonymised name, such as 'Admin'
