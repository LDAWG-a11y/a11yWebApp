Assistive technology is technology used by individuals with disabilities in order to perform functions that might otherwise be difficult or impossible. 

Digital Assistive technology includes hardware, software, and peripherals that assist people with disabilities to access information. For example, people who are blind may use software (screen readers) that reads text on the screen in a computer-generated voice, people with low vision may use software that enlarges screen content or people who cannot use a mouse or pointer due to low mobility may use voice recognition to control their devices and dictate their work.

A variety of assistive technology is available, providing the opportunity for people to access information technology (IT). Access to assistive technology is no guarantee of access. IT accessibility is dependent on accessible design so ensuring that digital systems meet the requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is key to ensuring that content will support the use of a wide range of assistive technologies and the people who use them. 

An additional benefit of an accessible by design approach to the delivery of information systems is that information will be more accessible to everyone and be served up in a variety of different ways to allow people to experience it in a variety of different ways to suit their access requirements and preferences regardless of accessibility requirements. 

Assistive technology can therefore be seen as a tool of Productivity to help everyone to get more from their digital experiences by managing work, study, and improving the accessibility of digital content by supporting users to tailor materials to their own requirements.

The functionality that supports screen reading technology can similarly be accessed to convert documents into mobile audio formats to support different means of access for example listening to meeting minutes whilst on a train journey or using text to speech to support proofreading. Lots of users report benefits from accessing captions for multimedia regardless of hearing loss. 

Microsoft Office now includes a range of technologies that may originally have been considered as assistive technologies as standard tools for interacting with Office file formats such as [Immersive Reader,](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/use-immersive-reader-in-word-a857949f-c91e-4c97-977c-a4efcaf9b3c1) [Dictation](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dictate-your-documents-in-word-3876e05f-3fcc-418f-b8ab-db7ce0d11d3c) and [captions in PowerPoint presentations](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/present-with-real-time-automatic-captions-or-subtitles-in-powerpoint-68d20e49-aec3-456a-939d-34a79e8ddd5f) alongside tools to check the accessibility of the content you are creating.
