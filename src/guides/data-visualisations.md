* Provide visualisations of adequate resolution. Low resolution screenshots are not suitable;
* All visualisations include captions and where possible alternative text descriptions;
* The context and educational importance of the content should be clear using only the text or caption;
* Colour is not used in visualisations as the only means of interpreting data;
* Be aware of the consequences of colour choice in visualisations. Consider colour combinations that affect colour blind users, for example red-green combinations;
* Use high contrasting colours for labelling and data;
* The original data on which visualisations are based is available in an accessible format where possible;
* Consider the feasibility of providing tactile images;
* If tactile images are used, carefully consider scale and resolution, and provide adequate labelling that works in all tactile media.
