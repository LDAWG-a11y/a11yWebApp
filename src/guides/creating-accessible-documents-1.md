**Creating Accessible Documents**

1. Use proper heading styles 

* Use the built-in heading features of the authoring tool.  
* Headings should form an outline of the page content.  
* Heading 1 for main heading 
* Heading 2 for first level of sub-headings 
* Heading 3 for next level of sub-headings, etc.  
* Don’t simply edit the appearance of text to make it stand out as a heading (i.e., increase font size and underline). [Use Microsoft guidance to help you build heading features.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-your-word-docume) 
* The heading tools create structures that allows screen reader software to identify different sections. This enables screen reader users to understand how the page is organised, and to quickly navigate to content of interest. 

2. Make sure that text can be selected, copied and pasted into another location; for example, do not embed or design text in an image (see point 5).

3. Write meaningful link text (text that links to a web address) that describes its destination. It needs to make sense when it is read out of context. 

* Don't write: "Click here to visit the Make Things Accessible website"  
* Write: "Visit the Make Things Accessible website" 

4. Use bullets or numbered lists to help people scan your content and quickly find what they need. Use the list styles so that screen readers (and those that use them) know that it is a list. Don't add spaces and dashes manually.

5. Add appropriate alternative text (alt text) if possible – or a full text alternative if the image conveys information not otherwise available. 

* Complex graphics such as infographics or flow charts can't be described through the 'alt text'. You will need to provide a full text alternative. 
* For purely decorative images you should enter two speech marks "" into the 'alt text' field rather than adding a pointless description or leaving it blank (which means its filename will be read out loud by screen readers, which is not helpful). 
* Most social media platforms have an accessibility option with alt text for posts, but they have varying character limits. You can also describe the image in the post or as a caption. 

6. Table structure matters. Don't use tables simply for layout; only use a table to display data. 

* If your data is best presented in a table, try to keep the table simple.  
* If the table is complex, consider whether you could use lists or divide it into multiple smaller tables with a heading above each. 
* A key to making data tables accessible to screen reader users is to clearly identify headers. (From the Table Design menu select Header row).
* Use bulleted lists instead of tables where you can.  
* For screen reader users, it is also useful to add a short descriptive caption for each table under Table Properties > Alt Text. 
* [Use Microsoft’s guidance on creating tables in documents](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office).  
* Keep the structure simple: don't split cells, merge cells, or use nested tables. 

7. Don't use colour alone to convey meaning (many people are colour blind). If using text on a coloured background or image background, you need to check its colour contrast. There are online tools available to help you check colour contrasts.

* [Check colour contrast for text over a background image](https://www.brandwood.com/a11y/) 
* [WebAIM contrast checker](http://webaim.org/resources/contrast) 

8. Fonts and styles can make a big difference to how accessible your information is. 

* Avoid underlining text unless it's a link. 
* Avoid italics or all capitals (they're harder to read if you have dyslexia).  
* Always left-align body text (to help dyslexic readers). 
* Use bold sparingly as it slows down reading and can look 'shouty'. 

9. Use these [plain English techniques](https://www.kent.ac.uk/guides/plain-english) to help you edit your draft texts and documents. Editing your text into plain English will make it clearer and more concise; this helps everyone quickly understand your message and is especially helpful to assistive technology users and those with dyslexia. 

10. Videos should be provided with audio descriptions and/or subtitles wherever possible.
