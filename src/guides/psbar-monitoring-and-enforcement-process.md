## How the monitoring works

The Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No.2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (PSBAR) are managed by three levels of monitoring and enforcement.

Read the [Memorandum of Understanding](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/memorandum-of-understanding-monitoring-and-enforcement-of-public-sector-website-accessibility/memorandum-of-understanding) which explains what each monitoring and enforcement organisation must do.

### Level 1 – Support

The first stage of most user complaints under PSBAR should come through the national support route. This support / complaint route is provided by the [Equality Advisory and Support Service](https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/) (EASS).

EASS should provide guidance material to users who wish to complain about inaccessible public sector websites. This guidance covers things like:

* Suggestions for engaging with the organisation to resolve the issue
* Users’ rights under PSBAR and the Equality Act
* A method to lodge a complaint which is passed on for monitoring

### Level 2 – Monitoring

The Monitoring body is often seen by many as the “owners” of PSBAR, being responsible for the original roll out of the regulations and monitoring the UKs progress towards compliance which includes reporting progress on the international stage.

The role of monitoring falls to the Cabinet Office, with the actual work being conducted by a specialist Digital Accessibility Monitoring Team. The monitoring team’s position within the government department has changed over the years, sometimes being referred to as GDS (The Government Digital Service), or the CDDO (Central Digital & Data Office). Currently they are known as GDS.

GDS monitors how the public sector are doing at complying with the regulations. To do this they test many hundreds of public sector websites every year against regulations requirements and send letters to organisations with lists of issues to be fixed.

Regularly GDS then have to announce figures for their monitoring results on behalf of the UK. This is fed back into the European Commission so we can see how we are doing compared to other countries.

### Level 3 - Enforcement

Enforcement is the final stage reserved for when a resolution cannot be reached regarding a user complaint, or a lack of action by a public sector body in response to government monitoring.

Enforcement is carried out by different agencies depending on where you are in the UK.

For England, Scotland and Wales, enforcement is carried out by the [Equality and Human Rights Commission](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en) (EHRC).

In Northern Ireland enforcement is carried out by the [Equalities Commission for Northern Ireland](https://www.equalityni.org/Home).

Where a public sector body has failed to engage with GDS and/or failed to fix the majority of non-compliance issues, the EHRC will consider whether it is proportionate to take enforcement action. It does this in accordance with its [litigation and enforcement policy](https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publication-download/our-litigation-and-enforcement-policy-2019-2022).
