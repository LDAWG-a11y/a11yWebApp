## Intro to WCAG 2.2

WCAG 2.2 is currently at the "Candidate Release" stage and it has been there for quite some time, this is the final stage before it becomes "Recommendation" or the new standard. It is anticipated by those working for or with the W3C that WCAG 2.2 will achieve Recommendation early in 2023, likely January.

WCAG currently has 9 additional success criteria (SC) or requirements to meet, in order to "conform to the standard", which are:

* 2 new Level A requirements
* 5 new Level AA requirements
* 2 new Level AAA requirements

In addition, one of the previous requirements is being removed, which is SC 4.1.1 Parsing (Level A), as the working group felt this requirement did not accurately explain the intent and has been the source of much confusion. Whilst the requirement is being removed, it does not remove the requirements to have well formed HTML etc, as these are typically recorded against both SC 1.3.1 Info and Relationships (Level A) and SC 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A), so we will just be reporting those issues under the most appropriate one of those, for the most part.
