**1. What matters most to your audience? Start with that!** 

Think about your audience: who are they and which part of your communication is  most important for them? What do they need to do? 

Put the key message first in the: 

* first words in email subject lines, headers, sentences 
* first paragraph of emails, documents and web pages  
* first sentence in a paragraph 

**2. Say “you” and “we”** 

Address your audience directly. Speaking to people in the third person creates  distance and is confusing. 

* **You** – not the client, members, students, staff, the patient, the applicant 
* **We** – not your organisation, business or department 

**3. Use active verbs most of the time** 

The active voice makes it easy to see who is doing what. It's clear who needs to take  action and what they need to do. 

* **Send the application to…** – not “The application needs to be sent to…” Use the passive only when you want to avoid assigning blame: “the fine hasn’t been  paid” is less confrontational than “you haven’t paid the fine.” 

**4. Write short sentences and paragraphs** 

* Best average sentence length: 15-20 words. But vary the length to keep your  audience’s attention 
* Keep paragraphs short: one topic per paragraph 
* Cut out padding and unnecessary politeness: people prefer clear instructions  to waffle 

**5. Use lists** 

* Use bullets to make multiple points easy to scan. 
* Use numbered lists to break down sequential steps.

**6. Use the simplest words that work in the context** 

People do understand the longer words, but their brains have to work much harder. ● **Need** – not require or requirement 

* **Tell** – not inform 
* **Help** – not assist or assistance 
* **Extra or more** – not additional 
* **If you ask** – not on request 

**7. Avoid nominalisations** 

They are nouns (thing words) made out of verbs (action words). They make it hard to  understand who is doing what.  

* Fail – not fail**ure** 
* Available – not availabil**ity** 
* Engage – not engage**ment** 
* Investigate – not investigat**ion** 
* Refuse – not refus**al** 

**8. Edit yourself – use the Hemingway app** 

Paste draft text into the hemingwayapp.com, which: 

* highlights long sentences, passive voice and adverbs and offers suggestions
* lets you edit on-screen to improve your text 
* gives a readability score 

**9. Use pair-writing** 

Get a colleague to help you craft key communications and documents, especially if  they will be shared with many people. Critical questions they could ask: 

* Who’s your target audience? 
* Is this really the best angle from the audience point of view? 
* Are the key points the audience cares about at the top? 

**10. Check the accessibility of your work for example using the [Accessibility Checker in Microsoft Office.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/improve-accessibility-with-the-accessibility-checker-a16f6de0-2f39-4a2b-8bd8-5ad801426c7f?ui=en-us&rs=en-us&ad=us)**
