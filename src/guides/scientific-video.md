* For rehearsed video, consider the interaction of foreground and background colour for viewers (e.g., green shirt against a red background) and how they may interact with caption colours;
* Effective audio description in video should be brief, clear, relevant, and included in any transcription;
* Presenters and narrators should ensure that any on screen activity are [described](<>) either verbally or in text/transcript form (e.g., the steps of an experiment, images/videos/other visuals, graphs etc);
* For accurate closed captions or transcripts:

  * Don't rely on auto-transcription for technical domains[.](<>) Always post-edit for correct terminology.
  * If using a transcription, captioning or sign interpretation service, provide them with a technical glossary in advance;
* Aim for clearest sound quality and little or no background noise.
