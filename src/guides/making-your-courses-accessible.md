This is an interactive resource we have created using Articulate Rise for teaching staff at the School of Advanced Study, London University. It designed to dismantle staff's preconceptions about accessibility and reduce anxiety by answering three questions: 

* **Why** do I need to make my module accessible?

* **What** do I need to do to make my module accessible?

* **How** do I put what I need to do into practice?

The tutorial takes an interactive and hands-on approach and will introduces staff to tools to make rendering their courses more accessible a lot easier. The tools covered include: Moodle's accessibility aids, Microsoft Word and Powerpoint, the WebAim Color Contrast Checker, Blackboard Ally and Panopto. Your institution may use similar but different tools, so some tweaking my be necessary. We have included activities and discussion prompts throughout the course, and it will conclude with a multiple choice quiz of eleven questions.
