Here you can find an interactive resource created using Articulate Rise for teaching staff at the School of Advanced Study, London University. It designed to dismantle misconceptions about accessibility and reduce anxiety by answering three questions: 

* **Why** do I need to make my module accessible?
* **What** do I need to do to make my module accessible?
* **How** do I put what I need to do into practice?

The tutorial takes an interactive and hands-on approach and introduces staff to tools that make rendering their courses more accessible a lot easier. The tools covered include: Moodle's accessibility aids, Microsoft Word and Powerpoint, the WebAim Color Contrast Checker, Blackboard Ally and Panopto. Your institution may use similar but different tools, so some tweaking on your part may be necessary. We have included activities and discussion prompts throughout the course, and it will conclude with a multiple choice quiz of twelve questions. 

You can access the course by selecting the link below:
