## Introduction

For the most part, when we click something on a website, it's usually a link or a button, there are other "clicky things" such as ARIA grid cells, ARIA menu items and other perfectly valid clickable things. There are also endless amounts of custom clicky things that tend to leave folk scratching their heads, such as poorly-implemented custom controls, when I discover these whilst testing a website, I tend to let out a somewhat judgemental sigh, because often what the developer tried and failed to achieve would have been much easier had they just used the correct element to start with.

Now, as I mentioned, I do get frustrated and a bit judgemental when I encounter these, that's not because they affect me, but it's because I know they can affect others and in most instances, they can completely prevent somebody from using a site altogether, which is obviously pretty awful.
