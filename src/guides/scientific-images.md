* Provide images of adequate resolution. Low resolution images are not suitable;
* Where documents are provided in large format, image etc must also be enlarged and should therefore be created in formats that can be re-sized;
* Where documents are provided in large format, formatting and cross-referencing consistency must be maintained;
* Be aware of the consequences of colour choice in images. Consider colour combinations that affect colour blind users, for example red-green combinations;
* In non-photographic illustration avoid contrasts that may be a problem for disabled viewers. Use high contrasting colours for labelling and data;
* Provide the context and purpose of the image in the alternative text, if not already described in context in surrounding text;
* Where images contain text, that text should be included in any alternative text or surrounding text descriptions;
* Where the image conveys complex information, consider describing the complexity in detail or include it in the main commentary.
