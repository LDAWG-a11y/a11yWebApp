## Introduction to Captions and Transcripts

This guide provides useful information on when to use captions and transcripts, and how to write captions and transcripts that are both meaningful and understandable for all users.

Captions and subtitles can often be used to describe the same thing, so we will use captions to refer to monolingual subtitles (external link) – spoken audio that is in the same language (same-language subtitles), and subtitles for intralingual subtitles (external link) - spoken audio that is translated into a different language.

Subtitles are not always an accommodation required for accessibility, but captions are needed for accessibility.

Please note that what the UK calls subtitles are called “closed captions” or “subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing (SDH)” In the USA, and Ofcom discovered that 7.5 million people in the UK (18% of the population) used closed captions (external website), and of that 7.5 million, only 1.5 million were d/Deaf or hard of hearing.

## What are captions and transcripts for

We use captions to provide the content of audio (whether audio only or video) to those who are Deaf, and other people who cannot hear audio.

Remember that they can be used by those who can process written information better than they can process audio. This could be someone with dyspraxia or autism. 3Play Media says in an article that 80% of people who use close captions are not hard of hearing (external website).

In the United States, one in eight people have a functional hearing limitation and this will only increase as the average age increases.

Multimedia content that has speech should have accessible captions that are:
* Equivalent to spoken words and other audio information
* Accessible or easily available to those who require it
* Synchronised to appear at the same time as the relevant audio

## Live Captions

These will be done either remotely or in-person by a professional real-time captioner or by a specialist provider of Communications Access Realtime Translation (CART).

Remember if you post a recording and it has captions which were live when it was recorded, you will need to check these for accuracy.

## Captions used to create Interactive Transcripts


Some media players have interactive transcripts generated from the caption files, that highlight text phrases as they get spoken


In the instance of YouTube (and some other players), when a caption in the transcript is selected, it will start playing that part of the video.
Don’t forget to achieve maximum accessibility, have an independent caption file of the description of the visual information (called video description, described video, aor udio description). You can use the caption to develop the transcript and vice versa as they  contain  the same text.
