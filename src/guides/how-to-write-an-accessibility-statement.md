You have decided to write a [Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations (PSBAR)](https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/what-are-the-public-sector-bodies-accessibility-regulations/) compliant accessibility statement. To write a correct statement there are a few pieces of information you will need in advance and a specific template you must adhere to for UK requirements.

If you want to know more about what statements are and what they apply to, read the [Accessibility statements - what are they guide](https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/accessibility-statements-what-are-they/).

## Before you write a statement

### Know your accessibility issues

The accessibility statement is the final piece of an accessibility testing journey. To write a statement you are going to provide information on known accessibility issues on a website which must include the standards they fail against, information about how this affects the users and what you are doing about it. To get this information you must first have completed some accessibility testing against the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

There are several ways to test including using semi-automated tools or manual testing. We always encourage a comprehensive accessibility audit which includes automated and manual testing, including testing with common pieces of assistive technology to get a good picture of the accessibility issues of a system.

You can get started on testing for accessibility with [semi-automated testing tools guide](https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/guides/semi-automated-accessibility-testing-tools/).

### Contact information and support

Besides knowing your accessibility issues, you will need to have a way for users to contact you to get help or request reasonable adjustments. Make sure you know where you are going to direct users to. Ideally this will have contact options such as an email address and phone number.

<div class="callout__info"><span class="callout__icon"></span><span class="callout__text">Never only offer a phone number. This can be a problem for Deaf users if there is no text option.</span></div>

If you have a dedicated team that supports alternative formats that is different to the contact who will support website accessibility issues, you should provide information about how users should request alternative formats.

Finally, try where possible to give information about how long users might have to wait for a response. For some services users may need a response urgently if there are deadlines or time constraints. Knowing if they are likely to get a response in a given time can be helpful for users to know whether they should use this contact route or find a more direct contact method elsewhere if they do need to escalate.

## The template

[Download the accessibility statement template](/docs/draft-accessibility-statement-2022.docx)

In the UK there is a specific template and several pieces of required legal wording that must go into an accessibility statement. The template provided by the UK Government through the Government Digital Service (GDS) who are the monitoring body for the regulations is in the form of a [sample statement for a fictional website](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sample-accessibility-statement/sample-accessibility-statement-for-a-fictional-public-sector-website).

This sample statement is the UK Government interpretation of the original legal document adopted from the [EU Web Accessibility Directive 2016 Model Statement](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eudn/2018/1523/2020-12-31) which was written into UK law.

You can follow the sample statement and create a correct accessibility statement for yourself, but we have seen many people make mistakes when writing statements from this template, such as not understanding disproportionate burden use correctly, or not applying the correct exemptions. More information on these issues is at the end of the guide.

There are also some automatic statement generators available online which have been created by various organisations. Some of these are aimed at the UK requirements while others are aimed at American markets. We have not found one yet that does create a completely compliant worded statement so we suggest that you continue to use the template and guide here to get the best results.

To help you write statements easily, with more prompts than in the GDS sample statement we have made the Make Things Accessible Accessibility Statement Template available to you all, donated by [All Able Ltd](https://www.allable.co.uk/), who are the international experts on accessibility statements, having completed significant research on [statements across the UK](https://www.allable.co.uk/research/accessibility-statements-v4) [and Europe](https://www.allable.co.uk/research/accessibility-statements-v3) and spoken at both the European Commission and European Parliament as the first comprehensive monitoring on the continent.

## How to write a statement – A video guide

To help you work through the template provided and understand the content that needs to go into each section, we have created this video guide showing George working through the template, giving information on each section and showing you the kind of information that needs to be provided.

## Things to watch out for

### Disproportionate burden

Disproportionate burden is a clause within the regulations that allows organisations to temporarily not meet parts of the legal requirements if to do so would create a “disproportionate burden” on the organisation. This can only be done in specific situations and a lot of people see this as a get out of jail free card.

Quick things to know about disproportionate burden:

* To make a claim and include it in the statement you must have significant evidence to back up your claim. Do not write a claim in this section of the statement unless you have documented evidence to support it first.
* If you are not making a claim, you still need to keep the section in, just say that you have not made any claims.
* Many people copy the wording from the GDS sample statement. This is example wording only. A holding block much like ‘Lorem Ipsum’ holding text. Do not leave it in the statements you write.
* We encourage everyone to check what exemptions may apply before making any disproportionate burden claims as these often get confused.

To better understand disproportionate burden, how it works and what you must do to make a claim read our [understanding disproportionate burden guide](https://www.makethingsaccessible.com/tags/disproportionate-burden/).

### Full compliance claims

Many organisations write in a statement that the website is ‘fully compliant’ without having tested the website, or without evidence to show this is the case. In our collective experience, most website are not fully compliant with the regulations or WCAG requirements, sometimes just because they are so large its almost an impossible task to make them compliant and keep them that way.

Often, if you see a statement for a fully compliant website, you can run a semi-automated checking tool on the home page and find several issues easily.

If you have not yet tested the website or have only done quick automated testing that revealed no issues, do not claim full compliance unless you are completely sure that is the case. The only way to do that is through comprehensive testing.

### Exemptions

There are several exemptions within the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations (PSBAR) that people get confused by. Accessibility statements have a section called ‘Content that’s not within scope of the regulations’. In this section you should mention any exemptions that apply to your website.

Many people are not as familiar with the exemptions available to them and often claim disproportionate burden for something when it is already exempted. We encourage everyone to check what exemptions may apply before making any disproportionate burden claims.

For a list of exemptions, what they apply to and where you might use them, read our exemptions guide.
