## Introduction to access keys

Web browser Access Keys were developed to enable a computer user to go to a particular web page or field immediately when a specified key is pressed alongside the Alt key. It is not recommended that they are used because they cause more issues for users of adaptive technology (AT) than they solve.

## History

In 1999 [Access Keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_key) were first introduced and most browsers now support them.

## UK Government accesskeys standard

The UK Government published in May 2002 the [Building in universal accessibility + checklist](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20100703000205/http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/e-government/resources/handbook/html/2-4.asp) (which was archived on 3 July 2010) and defined the [UK Government accesskeys standard](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20100703000205/http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/e-government/resources/handbook/html/2-4.asp#2.4.4) which recommends the following keys and their use:

## How to specify access keys

It can be helpful to the user to do something to show what key is the access key and this can be done in a number of ways. For example one method is to show which key is the access key via the use of an `<u>`

So for the link below

`<a href="index.aspx" accesskey="h">Home</a>`

It would be 

`<a href="index.aspx" accesskey="h"><u>H</u>ome</a>`

Or emphasis could be used

`<a href="index.aspx" accesskey="h"><em>H</em>ome</a>`

Or CSS can be used

`*[accesskey]:after {content:' [' attr(accesskey) ']'}`

## How to specify access keys

It can be helpful to the user to do something to show what key is the access key and this can be done by showing a list of the keys and what they do.

## Accessibilty concerns

* There is poor support amongst the browsers (and different operating systems use different keys to activate them)
* There is not a standardised set of accesskeys but if accesskeys are to be useful to a website, they must be specifically customised for that website â€“ the number of frequently used common keys are very small
* The accesskey may not work in a particular combination of AT, browser and OS whereas it will work in another
* Some accesskey values are missing on specific keyboards, such as particular language ones.
* There is the possibility of activating the accesskey accidentally if the user is not aware that it exists
* If the user has cognitive issues then accesskeys that use numbers can be confusing especially if the functionality does not have an association to the number that is logical
* The accesskey may conflict with short cut keys within the AT or the browser and stop important functionality being accessed
* Using the accesskeys can be more difficult that normal typing often requiring  greater dexterity

## Wrapping up

Due to the accessibility concerns of using access keys it is recommended that they are not used.
