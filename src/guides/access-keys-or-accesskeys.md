## Introduction to access keys

Web browser Access Keys were developed to enable a computer user to go to a particular web page or field immediately when a specified key is pressed alongside the Alt key. It is not recommended that they are used because they cause more issues for users of adaptive technology (AT) than they solve.

## History

In 1999 [Access Keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_key) were first introduced and most browsers now support them.

## UK Government accesskeys standard

The UK Government published in May 2002 the [Building in universal accessibility + checklist](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20100703000205/http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/e-government/resources/handbook/html/2-4.asp) (which was archived on 3 July 2010) and defined the [UK Government accesskeys standard](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20100703000205/http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/e-government/resources/handbook/html/2-4.asp#2.4.4) which recommends the following keys and their use:
