We assume that complex technology is not easily available to many content creators needed to produce tactile, audio-tactile, braille or augmented paper maps.

* Provide maps of adequate resolution. Low resolution screenshots are not suitable;
* All maps include captions and where possible alternative text descriptions. For example, directions in a navigational map, or summary description for information maps;
* Where the maps convey complex information, consider describing the complexity in detail or include it in the main commentary;
* The context and educational importance of the content should be clear using only the text or caption;
* Colour is not used in maps as the only means of interpreting data;
* Be aware of the consequences of colour choice in maps. Consider colour combinations that affect colour blind users, for example red-green combinations;
* Use high contrasting colours for labelling and data;
* Consider the feasibility of providing tactile maps;
* If tactile maps are used, carefully consider scale and resolution, and provide adequate labelling that works in all tactile media;
* Where documents are provided in large format, maps must also be enlarged and should therefore be created in formats that can be re-sized;
* Where documents are provided in large format, formatting and cross-referencing consistency must be maintained;
* Ensure that symbols, markers and labelling on maps is large enough and distinct enough to be **perceived** and differentiated easily;
* Different criteria apply depending on context of use. Where screen readers may be used, consider the reading order of graphical objects;
* Maps provided in special formats (tactile, etc) may require training to be useful to users.
