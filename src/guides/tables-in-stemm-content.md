* If large tables of data are essential, provide alternative format summaries of data;
* Signpost clearly for learners if it is important that they read through complete tables of data. Large tables are difficult for:
* Students who experience reading disabilities, such as dyslexia;
* Students who rely on magnification of documents;
* Students who navigate tables without sight, or who use of a screen reader;
* Consider moving large tables of data to appendices;
* Ensure that there are relevant headings for all columns and all rows;
* All data headings should appear on every page;
* Headings and names of data items are distinguished from data values;
* There are no blank or merged cells. **Where data are missing this is indicated**. Zero counts are shown as zero (and not left blank);
* Where possible, avoid nested tables;
* All tables include captions and titles, and where possible alternative text descriptions;
* The context and educational importance of the content should be clear using only the alternative text or caption;
* The table is navigable – the **tab order** of the cells is correct when read by software or navigated by keyboard alone.
