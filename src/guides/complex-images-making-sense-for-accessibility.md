[Complex Image Guidance](https://www.learningapps.co.uk/moodle/xertetoolkits/play.php?template_id=3023#page1) is hosted on learningapps.co.uk

This resource is aimed at Further and Higher Education institutions in the UK.

It is divided into 5 sections - Welcome, Background, Core principles, Recommendations and Suggested workflows.

We hope it proves useful as you embed digital accessibility across your organisation. It has been created as an open educational resource with no budget, no admin support or other resources... just a lot of goodwill from some passionate people. These include (in alphabetical order):

* Alistair McNaught (Director, A[listair McNaught Consultancy Ltd](https://www.learningapps.co.uk/moodle/xertetoolkits/play.php?template_id=2196)) - lead author supported by the following contributors, editors and critical friends.
* Amy Low (Service Delivery Director and Head of Accessibility, [AbilityNet](https://abilitynet.org.uk/)),
* Ben Watson, (Head of Digital Accessibility, UCL),
* George Rhodes (Digital Accessibility Lead, University of Westminster),
* Huw Alexander (Director, [textBox](https://www.textboxdigital.com/)), 
* Julian Tenney (Learning Content Team Leader, University of Nottingham),
* Lilian Joy (Education Adviser, University of York), 
* Susi Miller (Author of [Designing Accessible Learning Content](https://www.koganpage.com/product/designing-accessible-learning-content-9781789668056) and Director of [eLaHub](https://www.elahub.net/)
