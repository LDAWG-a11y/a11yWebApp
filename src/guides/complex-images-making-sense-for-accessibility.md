A team of digital accessibility experts have produced a new set of [guidance on complex image description](https://www.learningapps.co.uk/moodle/xertetoolkits/play.php?template_id=3023#page1). 

This resource is aimed at Further and Higher Education institutions in the UK.

In order to thrash out some workable suggestions, a group of us with significant experience of digital accessibility have come together to make suggestions about a pragmatic approach. As with all things in digital accessibility, these recommendations may evolve with time, technology and teaching practices but we hope they will be a useful starting point as you consider your own approaches. 

Please keep in mind that the primary aim in the suggestions is not to show you how to describe complex images to blind people. It’s the stage before that; ensuring that all users (blind or not) recognise the core type of image and data, the core purpose and the fact that if you can’t see it you are signposted to support.
