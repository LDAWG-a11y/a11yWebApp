A 3rd party usually means a person or organisation that is not necessarily a primary stakeholder in a project, as they do not need to play a significant part. An example could be a contract between a buyer and a reseller of some software, the contract is between the buyer and seller and the 3rd party is the software developers, if the software solution is exactly what the buyer needs, they may never need to speak to the 3rd party
