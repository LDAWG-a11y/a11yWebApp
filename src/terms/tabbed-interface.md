Not to be confused with navigating with the 'tab' key. A tabbed interface is a widget or component that has multiple 'tabs', each tab when currently selected will display the contents of that particular tab (Think dividers in a ring binder, where the labels of each divider are typically positioned in such a way that they do not overlap one another, allowing a person to quickly open the folder at the correct index or document)
