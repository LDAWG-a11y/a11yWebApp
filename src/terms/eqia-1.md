An Equality Impact Assessment (EqIA) is a review activity and associated documentation which are tools used to review the impact of any decisions on user groups who for example might fall within one of the protected characteristics of the Equality Act such as having a disability. Most organisations have their own processes and templates for these assessments and you should contact HR or EDI colleagues for direction.
