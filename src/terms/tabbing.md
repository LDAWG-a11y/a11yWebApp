"Tabbing" refers to the control by which keyboard and screen reader users move through interactive elements of a web page, app or system. These users press the tab key to move through all interactive elements and there are other controls for moving through just links or buttons etc. When a report says that an element could not be tabbed to, or you can't get to it by tabbing, it means that a user that is "tabbing" cannot get to that element through the common keyboard controls.
