There are two definitions for "intranets".
The first is the term for a specific type of internal facing company system that normally serves as a central place for important organisational material, such as links through to HR and IT services, policy information, organisational news and other internal content. The second is within the public sector bodies accessibility regulations (PSBAR) where "intranet" refers to ANY internal facing system that only organisation staff use.
