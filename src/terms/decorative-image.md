Some images are described as "decorative" in that they do not show any important information relevant to the context of the discussion. For example, a decorative image may be a nice picture in a powerpoint used, to fill space and "look nice" but not add any important information to the discussion. Decorative images have a "NULL" or blank alt text, or are specifically marked as decorative in document formats.
