An "extranet" is a term for a semi-open type of digital system. Intranets are available only for staff, and public facing systems are available to everyone. Extranets are managed systems that are open to select groups which may contain staff of your organisations, staff from other organisations, or members etc. Some public facing websites might have members sections or areas that a user can "login" to, which would be classed as an extranet. Another example of an extranet would be student systems for a university. These systems are not open to everyone, but are available to a wide customer base beyond just university employed staff.
