The definition for "public sector" within the Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations (PSBAR) is broad. Some organisations such as local government or NHS hospitals are public services and are clearly public sector. The regulations extends the definition to cover any organisation that is more than 50% funded or managed by other public sector bodies. For instance, universities that receive the majority of their funding through student loans from the government are classified as public sector in this specific context. This could also apply to local authority trading companies which are commercial branches of local government entities and are often majority managed by those local government public sector bodies.
