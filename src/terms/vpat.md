Virtual Product Accessibility Templates (VPATs) are a templated document required by the American Section 508 legal requirements. They include a WCAG 2.0 or later version checklist, functional criteria for use with various limitations or disabilities, hardware compliances, and support documentation requirements. VPATs are a common piece of evidence used internationally to demonstrate accessibility testing and compliance.
