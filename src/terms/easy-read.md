Easy Read content is a specific type of alternative format aimed at an audience with cognitive disabilities or other trouble easily understanding complex topics. Easy read content often breaks down complex topics into several points each accompanied by an associated image.
Easy read content is not the same as "plain English" which is an approach to making content clearer and easier to understand by a general audience.
