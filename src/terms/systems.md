When we say systems we are referring to a wide range of digital products which includes; any browser based platform (website, intranets), mobile applications, and other web content (plugins, chatbots, overlays). Systems may be built in house or purchased from 3rd parties. They may be customised to you, bespoke, or a generic service you subscribe to. This definition is used when discussing generic behaviour, such as asking for accessibility requirements in procurement regardless of the type of system. Where guidance applies to specific system types, more detail will be given.
