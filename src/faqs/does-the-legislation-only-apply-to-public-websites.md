No, the legislation applies to all websites. This includes internal websites which are available to staff and/or students only, as well as public websites.

What about websites supplied by an external supplier?

These are still subject to the legislation. We must work with the supplier to make sure they are improving accessibility of their website. We need to improve accessibility of the aspects we have control over eg content.
