Our websites need to be digitally accessible, as well as the content we publish on our websites. This content includes our “online estate” including Blackboard resources, blogs, online guides, website text, digital brochures, audio and video resources, Microsoft Office and PDF documents, social media content.

All these types of digital content need to be accessible for all audiences. This means public facing, student facing and staff facing content all must be accessible.
