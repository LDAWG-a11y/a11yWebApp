According to the [WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). These are international recommendations for improving web accessibility and contain standards which need to be met to be classified as accessible.

WCAG focus on principles of accessibility and emphasise the need to think about the different ways that people interact with content: 

For example, users might: 

* use a keyboard instead of a mouse 
* change browser settings to make content easier to read 
* use a screen reader to ‘read’ (speak) content out loud 
* use a screen magnifier to enlarge part or all of a screen 
* use voice commands to navigate a website 

This means you need to do things like: 

* provide captions for video 
* make sure content is structured logically and can be navigated and read by a screen reader - this also helps if stylesheets are disabled 
* not use colour as the only way to explain or distinguish something 
* use text colours that show up clearly against the background colour 
* make sure everything works for keyboard-only users 
* let people play, pause and stop any moving content 
* provide a ‘skip to content’ link 
* use descriptive titles for pages and frames.
