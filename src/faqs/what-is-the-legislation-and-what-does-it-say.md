The [Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations (2018)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made) say that a public sector body must make sure that websites and mobile apps are accessible. International web standards called [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) define what is needed for accessibility.

Public sector bodies must also publish an accessibility statement on each of their websites which tells users how accessible the website is, what problems are know about and how to contact for help if they have a problem with accessibility.
