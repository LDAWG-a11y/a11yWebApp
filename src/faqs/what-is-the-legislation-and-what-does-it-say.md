The [Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations (2018)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/contents/made) say that the University must make sure that our websites and mobile apps are accessible. International web standards called [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) define what is needed for accessibility. If they aren’t fully accessible yet, we need to improve the issues.

We must also publish an accessibility statement on each of our websites which tells users how accessible the website is, what problems we know about and how to contact us for help if they have a problem with accessibility. We need to update each accessibility statement at least once a year.

You may like to take a look at our [accessibility statement for the university public website](https://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-university/corporate-information/policies-and-documents-a-z/website-accessibility-statement) as an example.
